[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Verse 2: Shawn Mendes with Taylor Swift]
We could light a bunch of candles
And dance around the kitchen, baby
Pictures of when we were young would hang on the wall
We would sit on the stoop
I'll sing love songs to you when we're eighty
See, I finally got you now, honey, I won't let you fall

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Shawn Mendes, Shawn Mendes]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?

Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)

[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Shawn Mendes & Both]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
Look in my eyes, they will tell you the truth
The girl in my story has always been you
I'd go down with the Titanic, it's true, for you, lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover (Save you a seat)

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Shawn Mendes, Shawn Mendes & Taylor Swift]
Can I go where you go? (Can I go where you go, baby?)
Can we always be this close?

To the sides of my mind that I cannot help

And I can see all the lies in your eyes (Yeah, yeah)
You don't want this type of guy, right
In the morning, go back home because I do not have no ties (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 1]
Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
""Let It Snow"" is blasting out
But I won't get it in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

[Chorus]
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 2]
I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

[Chorus]
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Bridge]
Oh, I wanna have him beside me, like oh-woo-oh
On the 25th, by that fireplace, oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh, baby
(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
If he will be, if he will be here
(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
Oh, woah

[Chorus]
Santa, tell me (Santa, tell me) if you're really there ('Cause I really care)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year

My Lucifer is lonely

[Verse 1]
Standing there, killing time
Can't commit to anything but a crime
Peter's on vacation, an open invitation
Animals, evidence
Pearly Gates look more like a picket fence
Once you get inside 'em
Got friends but can't invite them

Hills burn in California

Don't say I didn't warn ya

'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team

[Post-Chorus]
My Lucifer is lonely

[Verse 2]
Look at you needing me
You know I'm not your friend without some greenery
Walk in wearin' fetters
Peter should know better
Your cover up is caving in
Man is such a fool, why are we saving him?
Poisoning themselves now
Begging for our help, wow

[Pre-Chorus]
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya

'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team

There's nothing left to save now
My god is gonna owe me
There's nothing left to save now

[Chorus]
She put my name with yellow hearts
Her favorite color, like the stars
I didn't listen very hard
When she told me she was crazy from the start
She put my name with yellow hearts (Yeah, she did)
I said she was a work of art (Work of art)
I didn't listen very hard (Very hard, no, no)
When she told me she was crazy from the start

[Verse 1]
I drive down open roads so slow
Here comes a train, I'll let it go
Ain't got nobody on my phone
Don't like being all alone (Don't like being all alone)
Not good at keeping with the trends (No, no)
Too good at welcoming amends
It's been a while since I've heard her say
That we were more than friends (Oh)
Oh, I, I-I-I, know a lot is going on
But girl, please tell me
And I'll let you be
Are you still with me or not?

I didn't listen very hard (Very hard, no, no)
When she told me she was crazy from the start

[Refrain]
She put yellow hearts around my name
I thought they were all just the same
To you, what do they really mean?
Have you only been playing games?

[Verse 2]
I'm by the garden with the carpenter bees
Like I'm Bob Ross-in' with a Harden beard
Taking it all in like I got no issues in my nature
Primroses blooming in the night
Birds wanna take me on a flight
Appreciating my land 'fore it turns into a glacier
Chasers are of no good use
This taste will be long endured
Why'd you have to go so soon?
I thought this was as good as new

My bitch probably one of the baddest
Good girl, turned her into a savage
Dispatch, got a problem in traffic
We came through in matching G-Wagens
Low-key, I've been keeping it classy
Could be really out here doin' 'em nasty
Niggas couldn't even see me in last year
Just started and them niggas in last gear
I ain't even try to and I passed 'em

She hit when she land, she bring me the bands, she back on the road
She know how I get when I get in that mode
Ain't fuckin' with bitches, ain't buying no clothes
Wanna do shows and make me some songs
Make sure that other shit come in, get sold
We fuck with the strippers 'cause we play with poles
We play with our money and not with our nose
I used to go to the West to get loads
I just came back from the West with a trophy
I'm on some more shit
She said she miss it and sendin' emojis
No time to kick it, I'm always in motion
Can't say I miss you, I don't got emotions
I'm on that back-when-I slept-on-the-floor shit
I'm on that me-and-the-bro-kick-a-door shit
I'm on that back-when-I-stood-at-the-stove shit
Ain't goin' broke, I'm just back on my old shit

I know one thing, I'm never gon' be hopeless

She said she miss it and sendin' emojis
No time to kick it, I'm always in motion
Can't say I miss you, I don't got emotions
I'm on that back-when-I slept-on-the-floor shit
I'm on that me-and-the-bro-kick-a-door shit
I'm on that back-when-I-stood-at-the-stove shit
Ain't goin' broke, I'm just back on my old shit
I'm takin' drugs, I don't know how to cope it
I know one thing, I'm never gon' be hopeless
If you tell 'em what was said, you a rodent
Drive the new Corvette like it's stolen, yeah

[Chorus]
Brand new car is noisy, come through and it's roarin' (Skrrt)
You ain't gotta worry, don't care about your boyfriend
See me and get nervous, I damn near did it perfect
Work hard and determine, it's safe to say I earned it, woah
Yeah, none of you guys get fly as me, woah
Matter of fact, none of you guys get high as me, woah
Post my drip up daily just so they can see, woah
Turn me up some more so my haters can hear it
Brand new car is noisy, come through and it's roarin' (Skrrt)
You ain't gotta worry, don't care about your boyfriend
See me and get nervous, I damn near did it perfect
Work hard and determine, it's safe to say I earned it, woah
Yeah, none of you guys get fly as me, woah

[Letra de ""Tusa""]

[Intro: Karol G & Nicki Minaj, Ovy On The Drums]
¿Qué pasa contigo? Dímelo
Rrr!
O-O-Ovy on the Drums! (Mmm)

[Verso 1: Karol G]
Ya no tiene excusa (No, no)
Hoy salió con su amiga dizque pa' matar la tusa (Ah; tusa)
Que porque un hombre le pagó mal (Ah)
Está dura y abusa (Eh)
Se cansó de ser buena
Ahora es ella quien los usa (Hmm-mm)
Que porque un hombre le pagó mal (Mal)
Ya no se le ve sentimental (-tal)
Dice que por otro man no llora, no (Llora)

[Coro: Karol G]
Pero si le ponen la canción (Hmm)
Le da una depresión tonta (Tonta)
Llorando lo comienza a llamar
Pero él la dejó en buzón (No)
¿Será porque con otra está (Con otra está)
Fingiendo que a otra se puede amar?

[Verso 2: Nicki Minaj]
Pero hice  todo este llanto por nada
Ahora soy una chica mala
And now you kickin' and screamin', a big toddler
Don't try to get your friends to come holla, holla
Ayo (Kyuh!), I used to lay low (Uh-huh)
I wasn't in the clubs, I was on my J.O (Oop!)
Until I realized you a epic fail
So don't tell your guys that I’m still your bae, yo (Ah!)
'Cause it's a new day, I'm in a new place (Uh-huh)
Gettin' some new D, sittin' on a new face (Okay)
'Cause I know I'm the baddest bitch that you ever really met (Oop!)
You searchin' for a badder bitch, and you ain't met her yet (Oop!)
Ayo! Tell 'em to back off, he wanna slack off
Ain't no more booty calls, you gotta jack off
It's me and Karol G, we let them rats talk
Don't run up on us, 'cause they lettin' the MACs off (Rrr!)

[Coro: Karol G]
Pero si le ponen la canción (Hmm)
Le da una depresión tonta (Tonta)
Llorando lo comienza a llamar
Pero él la dejó en buzón (No)
¿Será porque con otra está (Con otra está)
Fingiendo que a otra se puede amar?
Eh, ah

[Verso 3: Karol G]
Un-un shot pa' la pena profunda (Un shot, eh)
Y seguimo' gastando la funda (La funda)
Otro shot pa' la mente (Yeah, yeah)
Pa' que el recuerdo no la atormente (Ah; Oh)
Ya no le copia a nada (Na')
Su ex ya no vale nada (Nada)
Se va pa' la disco y sólo quiere perrear (Perrear)
Pero se confunde cuando empieza a tomar (Tomar)

[Pre-Coro: Karol G]
Ella se cura con rumba (Ah)
Y el amor pa' la tumba (Yeah)
To' los hombre' le zumban (Le zumban)

[Coro: Karol G]
Pero si le ponen la canción (Oh)
Le da una depresión tonta (Tonta)

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

[Chorus]
And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear 'they don't deserve you'""

[Verse 2]
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head

Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?

To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

[Chorus]
And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear 'they don't deserve you'""

[Verse 2]
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

[Chorus]
And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear 'they don't deserve you'""

[Outro]
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?

Homie, better put your pride aside (Aside)
I'm a Benz and you're more like a Volvo
Your best stuff looks like my worst, synapses fire and burst
Got the whole crew with me, 'bout to deal damage
You know we ain't average (Oh yeah)
I ain't gonna say this again
But this is my time, better look in my eyes
I'm a genius in disguise, wear my heart on my sleeve
And you forced to oblige to a king in his prime (Yeah, yeah)

I finesse like my life on the line
Was a diamond in the rough and now I shine (Woo)

I didn't feel it when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', were you out drinkin'?
Were you in the living room, chillin', watchin' television?
It's been a year now, think I've figured out how
How to let you go and let communication die out

Down for forever and it's fine
I know you know we know we weren't

You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?

If the world was ending, you'd come over right?
The sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight
And there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye

If the world was ending, you'd come over, right? Right?

But it really got me thinkin', the night we went drinkin'

[Intro]
Doctor Love

[Verse 1]
Living life all wrong
'Cause I thought I knew what love was
But my heart, it was made of stone
I was out there seeking after hours for money, looks and power
But all that glows ain't always gold

[Pre-Chorus]
And just give me some love
'Cause I'm running out of that feeling
Doctor, prescribe me that drug
'Cause I need some more of your healing

[Chorus]
Baby, turn me on, turn me on (Healing)
Baby, turn me on, turn me on (Healing)
Baby, turn me on, turn me on (Healing)
You know just what I needed, Doctor Love

Doctor Love

[Verse 2]
Living life in darkness, this fight is full of nonsense
Trying to navigate through my mistakes
But ever since I met someone who taught me that love is like a party
I can never dim the lights again

[Pre-Chorus]
And just give me some love
'Cause I'm running out of that feeling
Doctor, prescribe me that drug
'Cause I need some more of your healing

[Verso 1: Lorduy, DIM & Lorduy, DIM]
Ya no aguanto tanto trago
He pensado matar lo que he olvidado
Mis amigo' me la tiraron (¡Wuh!)
Que como siga así, voy pa'l carajo
Yo ya olvidé lo que es el relajo
No juego FIFA desde hace rato (¡Wuah!)
Botellas a medias no me quedaron
Tomo un trago y otro trago
Me da por poner dizque a Dalmata y Ñejo
Y a veces escucho el consejo del viejo
La verdad e' que te fuiste lejo'
Quedé con la cara de pendejo
Tengo una vaina guarda' en el pecho (¡Wuh!)
¿Será despecho?
Como huevón mirando pa'l techo
Ya lo hecho está hecho

[Coro: DIM & Christian Nodal]
Por favor que alguien me diga
Que se toma pa' las penas
Cuando está recién herido
Y el alcohol no ayuda
Pa' olvidarme de ella
Pa' olvidarme de ella
Ya bailé con otros labios
Y me acuerdo siempre de ella
He cantado mil rancheras
Y el alcohol no ayuda
Pa' olvidarme de ella
Pa' olvidarme de ella (Ajajajay; ba-bu-eh)

[Verso 2: Christian Nodal & DIM]
Que descanse en paz aquí
Tú te fuiste y yo me fui
Mi cuerpo camina solo
Mi alma se fue 'trás de ti
Tú no tienes la culpa
Que yo no me acostumbre a estar sin ti
(Yo no me acostumbro a estar sin ti)
Pero si voy a olvidarte
Te lo juro por quien quiera
Solo es cuestión de tiempo
Hasta que llegue una más buena que tú (Que tú)
Que lo haga mejor que tú, uh (Que lo haga mejor que tú)

[Coro: Christian Nodal & Lorduy]
Por favor que alguien me diga
Que se toma pa' las penas

Ya bajé Tinder en mi celular
Y subí una foto pa' que le dé match

Al tequila duro quiero darle
A mis penas yo las quiero ahogar
Pero las cabronas ya saben nadar (Yeh)

[Intro: Taylor Swift]
I promise that you'll never find another like me

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Verse 2: Brendon Urie & Taylor Swift]
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Brendon Urie, Brendon Urie]
'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin' in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Intro]
If you don't wanna see me

[Verse 1]
Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

[Chorus]
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

[Verse 2]
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody

[Intro: Gunna]
Wheezy outta here
Hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot

[Chorus: Gunna]
Everything litty, I love when it's hot
Turned up the city, I broke off the notch
Got some more millis, I keep me a knot
I created history and made me a lot
He tried to diss me and ended on Fox
We call 'em chopsticks 'cause they gonna chop
Took her out of Follies 'cause her pussy pop
I run it like Nike, we got it on lock

[Verse 1: Gunna]
Cartier eye
I'm the bossman in a suit but no tie
I can't be sober, I gotta stay high
Pour me some syrup in a Canada Dry
Ridin' in the spaceship like Bonnie and Clyde
Don't worry, baby, I keep me some fire
Shenenehs and Birkins, she cannot decide
The latest Mercedes her go-to surprise
Don't sleep on miss lady, her pussy a prize
Dick in her back while I'm grippin' her sides
Bigger Maybach, this ain't regular size
We really fly, we like pelican glide
Bitch, you ain't slick, I can tell the disguise
Upgraded my wrist, put baguettes in that Sky
She sing, I might sign her and change her whole life
I told her to gargle and work on her highs

[Chorus: Gunna]
Everything litty, I love when it's hot
Turned up the city, I broke off the notch
Got some more millis, I keep me a knot
I created history and made me a lot

Took her out of Follies 'cause her pussy pop
I run it like Nike, we got it on lock

[Interlude: Young Thug]
Cash, money, checks, cash
Addy, Birkin, brand new extendos
I just wanna fuck the bitch by myself
I just passed her to the dawg like my Sprite

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I took the Bentley coupe back, then I hopped in a Cayenne (Skrrt)
I put the bitch in the front of the Bentley, in front of the driver (Skrrt)
Ayy, man, this synthetic weed, you can't smoke in the Rolls Royce, woah, woah (Yeah, yeah)
I'm still double cupped up, I'm drinkin', I shoot off your tires, huh (Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
I'm in the coupe by myself
I had to kick a door when I was 5
Keep the awards on the shelf
Whole sixteen round in the fire
I'm sick and tired of these young niggas act like they firin', they tellin' these lies
Actin' like they the ones created this and they get all the drip from my guys
Yeah, Cartier eyes
Cartier coat, Cartiers the watch
Cartier love, Cartier the thot
Cartier specs, buffalo on the side
Princess cut diamonds, they Cartier, yeah
Cartier bag for the Cartier thot
Sky Wrangler coupe with two hundred the dash
Cartier jeans, ain't no way I can sag
Ain't no way I'ma ever gon' go out bad
I can't go out, no way I'ma go out
I just grip on her ass and I show out
I sit like a champ and I wait on a hold-out
I just whip up a new Chanel Patek
I whip with the wrist and I don't break the door out
Turn the whole top floor to a whorehouse
Hundred racks in ones, dude brought the flood out (Oh)

[Interlude: Young Thug & Travis Scott]
Cash, money, checks, cash (Ooh, ah)
Addy, Birkin, brand new extendos (Ooh)
I just wanna fuck the bitch by myself  (Ah)
I just passed her to the dawg like my Sprite (Ooh, it's lit)

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
Hot like the 504 Boyz how I move through the lobby (Hot)
Since '012, La Flame been hot just to show you the timeframe (La Flame)
Hundred mil' down on my desk, but I'm still up deciding (Straight up)
Match the M's in my account to the truck in my driveway (Skrrt, skrrt)
I'm in that four-door by myself
Know it's a hundred more niggas outside
Know they gon' ride 'til the death (Ooh)
Had some good years, ain't no way I get tired
I gotta do what I feel
Every day Super Bowl, fuck it, oh well
I put a lot on myself
In the field, Richard Mille on like Odell (Let's go)
She slid her hand down my pants just to grab the torpedo (Doo-doo-doo)
I had to go back and link with my slimes like I'm thirteen and zero (It's lit)
I told her, ""Baby, this not the remix, this a part of the sequel"" (Part of the seq')
No, we not livin' the same, we not makin' the same, we not equal (No), yeah, yeah, yeah
Look, mom, I can fly
Had some troubles, put that shit in the sky
Brought the angels, know the devil would try
It's so hot, you thought Paris Hilton done said it (Yeah, yeah)
When we come out, we can't help but leave damage (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Afterparty, Astroworld out the planet (Yeah, yeah)
Laid the map out, but they didn't understand it
When I'm home, know that I fuck on a Grammy, yeah

[Outro: Gunna]

[Intro]
21
I feel like the motherfuckin' Grim Reaper
The biggest smoke blower
Put a motherfuckin' chimney on my stick

[Verse 1]
Brand new MAK-90 with the drum attached (Drum)
You a shit talker, we got drums for that (On God)
Tryna fist fight? Boy, you dumb for that (Stupid)
You gon' get a bullet in your lung for that (Stupid)
Draco get to kickin' like Liu Kang (21)
F&N on me in the Mulsanne (Straight up, straight up)
Glock 19 in the Blue Flame (Straight up, straight up)
I was strapped when I slid inside your boo thang (On God)
21 immortal, we'll never die (21)
Loyal to my brothers (Yeah), I'll never lie (On God)
Call me bird dog 'cause I cheat and I'm fly (Straight up)
And I love winnin', I'm upset if it's a tie (On God)
Get you off the ground just to knock you to the floor (Yeah)
Let's go blow for blow (Yeah), let's go toe to toe (Straight up)
When it's time to battle, they don't never ever show (21)
When it's time to battle, I'm the first one at the door (21)
At the door with a Draco
Don't nobody move, I don't wanna have to blow
Rappin' ass niggas get spinned at they show
That's why I need some help, I got a fetish for the smoke
It get fatal in the bottom, used to rumble in the den (21)
Hit him with a combo, gotta finish him (21)
AK make you frown since you think you wanna grin (Straight up)
Seems like all the models just be fallin' in my DM's (Yeah)
Coolant on the TEC, it get hot like Scorpion (Hot)
I'll burn his ass, lil' buster
You thought it was straight, I got some chemicals in this magazine
I'll perm his ass (Mark ass nigga)
Wanna be a gangster, but he misguided (Bitch)
I'll learn his ass (On God, nigga)
He went against me and they called 9-1-1 (21)
They had to infirm' his ass (You gon' be next, nigga)
""How many tops you done got popped?"" Whole bunch
""How many times you ran from the smoke?"" Nigga, not once
Eastside nigga fuckin' all the hoes, and I love guns
Ain't no fucking diamonds in my mouth, nigga, these gold fronts
And we known to handle all the business, nigga, ASAP
Had her at the slaughterhouse, how the fuck you cape that?
Ain't no body shots, nigga, you know I told him face that
Now he in the ocean, heard they hit him in his wave cap
You took your shot and you missed it (21)
I just beat it up and you kissed it (Ugh)
Took the rap game and I milked it (Yeah)
Took the rap beef and I killed it
Neck all froze like Sub Zero, dawg (Straight up)
He wifed a thot, he a hero, dawg (Straight up)
All I care about is my dinero, dawg (On God)
Only thing I'm chasing is dineros, dawg (Straight up)
Dread-headed killer like Cyrax (21)
Brought a gun to a fist fight like Jax (Pew-pew-pew-pew-pew)
Nah, fuck that, only thing scare me is a rat (Snitch)
Slaughter Gang, pick your poison, dagger or the axe (Straight up)
Stand-up guy, they respect my mind (On God)
If you foul out, get a tech', my nine (Straight up)
If you ain't a hundred, don't text my line (Lil' bitch)
If you know you hatin', don't check my Live (Snitch)

[Chorus]
You know I'm Slaughter Gang so the smoke is immortal
Ain't nothin' changed, I'll slaughter your daughter
She said she was a dime, but her friend was a quarter
I had a threesome, then I flushed the rubber down the toilet
She tried to give me head, it was boring
Codeine got a nigga snoring
I wonder if she would've slept with the poor me
Savage keep a Draco and it corn beef

[Verse 2]
Chopper cut you up like Kitana (Ching-ching)
My chopper in the band, it's a drummer (Drumroll)
Russell Westbrook, I was strikin' like the Thunder (Woah, woah)
You was somewhere runnin' 'round whinin' to your mama (21)
Y'all play conservative, we gon' send a blitz (Straight up)
I'm the type to catch a tech', foul, hit him in his shit (On God)
He think he a made man, hit him in the head (Pussy)
Don't you try to run now, hit him in the leg (Rraow)
People wanna say the stuff I say, but they be scared (Pussy)
Jab turn a lightskin pretty boy red (21)
It's a fatality if you try to handle me (Yeah)
Real top shotta, don't you ever try to ramp with me (On God)
Got enough bullets that could kill your whole camp with me (Rrah)
I was bad as hell in school, they even tried to counsel me (21)
I don't like to talk, don't you try to tongue-wrestle me (On God)
And my block good, you'll never get the best of me (Straight up)

[Chorus]
You know I'm Slaughter Gang so the smoke is immortal

[Verse 1]
Walking through the door of this old and lonely
Place that used to feel like us
Remembering the only thing that made me
Feel like I was worth the love

[Pre-Chorus]
We used to hold hands, now I dance alone
We had Springsteen playing so loud
We danced in the dark till it felt like home
With you, home was anywhere

[Chorus]
But you will never be left behind
Give me a moment, I need just a little more time
If I could, I would have made things right
But we can't go back to the way that we used to love
Never apart you're still running through my blood
But we can't go back to the way that we used to love
But we can't go back to the way that we used to love
We can't go back to the way that we used to–

[Verse 2]
Be talking through the night, you laying by my side
You were always there to heal my scars
And into the dawn I do my best to try and find some sleep
But you still keep me up

We had Springsteen playing so loud
We danced in the dark till it felt like home

I’m running from, I’m running from the emptiness
But I can’t escape, you’re still in my head

A s-a scuola avevo la lean nel backpack, clean
Curavo l'incertezza e l'imbarazzo
Io m'imbarazzo
Quando penso a te

[Strofa 2: Sfera Ebbasta]
Bang, bang, non capisci lo slang, slang
Che ne sai della gang, gang? Tu non sei della gang, gang (brr)
Dalle popo' alle Top 10 (brr), questi mi odiano a morte (brr)
Perché sono la voce di chi non ha mai avuto voce, eh (uh, yah, yah, yah)
E uno metteva i vestiti dell'altro (ah)
Perché ero proprio come te, fra', non avevo un cazzo (uh, ah)
Ora parlano di noi, sì, anche nel tuo palazzo
Non mi disturbare, fra', mentre li sto contando
Uno, due, tre, quattro (uoh)
Pistola fa (pah, pah) come i film
Conosco già la tua bitch, pensa che imbarazzo
Spendo 'sti soldi e li rifaccio
Non ci penso a te

[Intro]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah

[Verse 1]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need (And I)
Don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace (Ah)
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

[Chorus]
I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

[Verse 2]
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow (And I)
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick (Ah)
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

[Chorus]
'Cause I just want you here tonight (Ooh)
Holding on to me so tight (Ooh)
What more can I do?
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

[Bridge]
Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere (So brightly, baby)
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air (Oh, oh yeah)
And everyone is singing (Oh yeah)
I hear those sleigh bells ringing (Oh)
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh, oh)
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

[Verse 3]
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for (Ah)
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door

Oh, I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)

Tangerine, yeah, I call her sweet and sour
And my lawyer say it's urgent, I'ma call him in a hour (Ooh)

[Verse 3: MadeinTYO]
Yeah, hopped off the flight, Louis V, Off-White (Ooh)
I just made a dub and she tryna spend the night (Uh)
Heard they need more, yeah, my jeans Dior (Ooh)
Shawty got cake if you tryna eat more (Skrrt, skrrt)
Think they need more, I think they need more (Ooh, brrt, ooh)
This the second round, I'm tryna speed more (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Going stupid, going crazy (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Big gas in that Mercedes (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Pull up lit, uh, going 30 (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Pull up Vic, uh, in a hurry (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Shoot your shot, uh, flex a lot (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Big cheese, uh, hella knots (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Chopped and screwed, Michael Watts (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Point 'em out, air 'em out (Skrrt, skrrt)
Get me right, sippin' Sprite (Skrrt, skrrt)
180, halfpipe (Skrrt, skrrt)
Ooh

And my lawyer say it's urgent, I'ma call him in a hour

[Verse 4: DaBaby]
Goddamn
Think I got a new lawsuit, I need to come see you (What's that?)
I got a new whip, you know what a car do
Turn your bitch to a eater (Mmh, mmh)
She say we don't got enough room to get freaky in here
'Cause it's just a two-seater (Okay, question)
Am I still considered a trick if I get her a hoopty
And buy me a Bimmer? (Uh-uh)
I had a new case but the judge had to throw it out
My lawyer beat it like Tina
I always find a way to get ahead with my intelligence
When they critique my demeanor (Hah)
Today I'll dress up a Republican (What else?)
And go get some head from a white man's daughter
Her lips aren't big but I'm loving it (Mwah)
I get in, fake ID, I'm McLovin it (Yeah)
BDB ENT like the government (What?)
Except for the cops (Who?), mission impossible
Strapped with the Glock, Danny Gloverin'
Tip a hundred if you let my cousin in
You know everybody my cousin (Cuz)
Oh yeah, and I gotta be thuggin' it
'Cause my hair can get nappy as fuck
I wear jewelry and I got that chocolate coloring

[Interlude: DaBaby]
Well at least, like you know, that's what they make me feel like
Why they make you feel like that?
I don't know, I mean it's America, right?

[Intro: Dalex]
Mi bellaquita, ah-ah
Es una cosa de locos
Cómo ese culo me tiene envicia'o (Envicia'o)
Desde que lo hicimos me quedé juquea'o (Me quedé juquea'o)
Tus gemidos se quedaron graba'os en mi mente

[Pre-Coro: Dalex]
Dime si estás puesta pa' mí esta noche
Yo quiero quitarte ese panticito Dolce
Dime si estás puesta pa' mí esta noche
Que hoy yo quiero darte (Yeih)

[Coro: Dalex & Lenny Tavárez]
Ponte encima de mí, bellaquita
No calles lo que sientes y grita
Que los vecinos se enteren (Enteren)
Y si llegan los guardias, que esperen (Esperen)
Que sepan quién es tu hombre
Que los vecinos se aprendan mi nombre (Uh-yeh)
Ponte encima de mí, bellaquita
No calles lo que sientes y grita
Que los vecinos se enteren (Enteren)
Y si llegan los guardias, que esperen (Esperen)
Que sepan quién es tu hombre
Que los vecinos se aprendan mi nombre (Eh)

[Verso 1: Lenny Tavárez]
Lenny Tavárez, baby
Si tu cama hablara, diría que llovía cuando te rompía
Siempre con altura como Rosalía (¡Woh!)
Yo quiero chillear, pero ella quiere sex
Yo la quiero también, pero no como Flex (Flex)
Es tiempo de apagar el cel' (El cel')
Si ella es bellaca, me quiero parecer (Me quiero parecer)

[Verso 2: Dalex]
Señor oficial, yo la puse a gritar
No hizo nada malo, pero la tuve que castigar (Castigar)
Tiene carita de que no falla una misa (Misa)
Pero le encanta bellaquear bajo la frisa (Frisa)
Y mi único delito fue comerme ese culito (Ese culito)
Yo le di nalgada' porque no quería besito' (No quería besito')
Y por eso fueron los grito' (Grito')
La víctima gritaba: ""¡Qué rico!"" (Uh-yeh, uh-yeh; yeih)

[Letra de ""Bellaquita""]

[Intro: Dalex]
Mi bellaquita, ah-ah
Es una cosa de locos
Cómo ese culo me tiene envicia'o (Envicia'o)
Desde que lo hicimos me quedé juquea'o (Me quedé juquea'o)
Tus gemidos se quedaron graba'os en mi mente

[Pre-Coro: Dalex]
Dime si estás puesta pa' mí esta noche
Yo quiero quitarte ese panticito Dolce
Dime si estás puesta pa' mí esta noche
Que hoy yo quiero darte (Yeih)

[Coro: Dalex & Lenny Tavárez]
Ponte encima de mí, bellaquita
No calles lo que sientes y grita
Que los vecinos se enteren (Enteren)
Y si llegan los guardias, que esperen (Esperen)
Que sepan quién es tu hombre
Que los vecinos se aprendan mi nombre (Uh-yeh)
Ponte encima de mí, bellaquita
No calles lo que sientes y grita
Que los vecinos se enteren (Enteren)
Y si llegan los guardias, que esperen (Esperen)
Que sepan quién es tu hombre
Que los vecinos se aprendan mi nombre (Eh)

[Verso 1: Lenny Tavárez]
Lenny Tavárez, baby
Si tu cama hablara, diría que llovía cuando te rompía
Siempre con altura como Rosalía (¡Woh!)
Yo quiero chillear, pero ella quiere sex
Yo la quiero también, pero no como Flex (Flex)
Es tiempo de apagar el cel' (El cel')
Si ella es bellaca, me quiero parecer (Me quiero parecer)

[Coro: Dalex & Lenny Tavárez]
Ponte encima de mí, bellaquita
No calles lo que sientes y grita
Que los vecinos se enteren (Enteren)
Y si llegan los guardias, que esperen (Esperen)
Que sepan quién es tu hombre
Que los vecinos se aprendan mi nombre (Uh-yeh)

[Verso 2: Dalex]
Señor oficial, yo la puse a gritar
No hizo nada malo, pero la tuve que castigar (Castigar)
Tiene carita de que no falla una misa (Misa)
Pero le encanta bellaquear bajo la frisa (Frisa)
Y mi único delito fue comerme ese culito (Ese culito)
Yo le di nalgada' porque no quería besito' (No quería besito')
Y por eso fueron los grito' (Grito')
La víctima gritaba: ""¡Qué rico!"" (Uh-yeh, uh-yeh; yeih)

[Coro: Dalex]
Ponte encima de mí, bellaquita
No calles lo que sientes y grita
Que los vecinos se enteren (Enteren)

And turned it to pop, he think that he Elvis
And he ungrateful, they don't say thank you
They don't say grace, not even for meals, not even for millions

Richard Mille, look at my ears, flooded with diamonds
Look at my skills, running through blocks like 49ers
Forty-nine diamonds, stuffed in my bracelet
That cost a whop, that cost a whopper
And it ain't new, I had a knot at John Ehret in my locker
Pretty still, it ain't no pretty pill
It's either real or real
Real easy on the eyes, green like a soccer field

[Letra de ""Atrévete""]

[Pre-Coro: Nicky Jam & Sech]
Desde hace tiempo, eh
Yo quiero llevarte lejos (Lejos)
Si me permites, te lo juro que será diferente (Diferente)
Sé que te han fallado un montón, pero atrévete

[Coro: Nicky Jam & Sech]
¿Qué opinas si te vas conmigo (-migo)
Y la noche paso contigo? (-tigo)
Ya siento que hasta te combino (-bino)
Baby, solo atrévete
¿Qué opinas si te vas conmigo, oh-oh
Y la noche paso contigo? (Oh-oh)
Ya siento hasta que te combino (-bino)
Baby, solo atrévete (Yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh)

[Verso 1: Nicky Jam & Sech]
Atrévete a escaparte
Yo sé que esto es parte por parte (Eh, eh, eh, eh)
Pero él se fue en seguida
Y yo sí pienso quedarme hasta amarte
Si él supiera lo que pierde, yo sé que estaría buscándote
Si él supiera lo que pierde, te llamaría otra vez

[Coro: Nicky Jam & Sech]
¿Qué opinas si te vas conmigo (-migo)
Y la noche paso contigo? (-tigo)

¿Qué opinas si te vas conmigo, oh-oh
Y la noche paso contigo? (Oh-oh)
Ya siento hasta que te combino (-bino)

[Verso 2: Sech & Nicky Jam]
Vámono' sin miedo, mami, escápate, eh
Que no hay manera 'e que te atrapen (Eh)

[Verse 1]
Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

[Pre-Chorus]
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

[Chorus 1]
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

[Verse 2]
Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing to take with us when we die

[Pre-Chorus]

And time's forever frozen, still

Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me, that's okay baby
Only words bleed inside these pages
You just hold me
And I won’t ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

[Bridge]
Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me, that's okay baby
Only words bleed inside these pages
You just hold me
And I won’t ever let you go

[Outro]
When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home

[Intro]
Get to roll no...
Ayy, I'm in the studio, bro
Oh, nah, yeah, call me, ball me
Yeah, I'll... bet
Yeah, I'm at the studio, hold up though

[Verse 1]
I ain't get to roll no weed, I ain't get to roll no Swishers
I was locked up on Christmas, ain't get to see my niggas
Ain't get to hug my mama, couldn't even give her no kisses
Can't even post on my Instagram 'cause these pussy niggas be snitching
Everybody acting suspicious, might probably say that I'm tripping
When I'm all alone in my jail cell, I tend to get in my feelings
And all I smoke is that loud, don't pass me no midget
And I'ma smoke all of my pain away 'cause that's the only thing that gon' heal it
I don't understand these women who go around pretending
As if they really fuck with me, so I love 'em all from a distance
'Cause the same bitch say she down to ride be the main one who tricking
Got Molly mixed with promethazine 'cause every time

[Chorus]
I wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind
AK-47's, MAC-11, Glocks, and nines
And all these pussy niggas hating, tryna knock me off my grind
But I can't let 'em do it, I got murder on my mind
Bitch, I got murder on my mind (Bitch, I got murder on my mind)
I got murder on my mind (On my mind)
I got murder on my mind (I got murder on my mind)
I got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind

[Verse 2]
Yellow tape around his body, it's a fucking homicide
His face is on a T-shirt and his family traumatized
I didn't even mean to shoot him, he just caught me by surprise
I reloaded my pistol, cocked it back, and shot him twice
His body dropped down to the floor and he got teardrops in his eyes
He grabbed me by my hands and said he was afraid to die
I told him it's too late, my friend, it's time to say goodbye
And he died inside my arms, blood all on my shirt

[Chorus]
Wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind
AK-47's, MAC-11, Glocks, and nines
And all these pussy niggas hating, tryna knock me off my grind
But I can't let 'em do it, I got murder on my mind

I got murder on my mind (On my mind)

I got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind

Melly's a savage, no he not no amateur
Bad bitch named Angela, fucked her on camera
Bitch I'm a murderer (Yeah, yeah)
I might just kill the boy, don't wanna kill the boy
Bake him up, say he want beef, we gon' grill the boy
(Grill the boy, we gonna grill the boy)
I'm bleeding so good, I might dip his ass in it and spill the boy

[Intro]
Get to roll no...
Ayy, I'm in the studio, bro
Oh, nah, yeah, call me, ball me
Yeah, I'll... bet
Yeah, I'm at the studio, hold up though

[Verse 1]
I ain't get to roll no weed, I ain't get to roll no Swishers
I was locked up on Christmas, ain't get to see my niggas
Ain't get to hug my mama, couldn't even give her no kisses
Can't even post on my Instagram 'cause these pussy niggas be snitching
Everybody acting suspicious, might probably say that I'm tripping
When I'm all alone in my jail cell, I tend to get in my feelings
And all I smoke is that loud, don't pass me no midget
And I'ma smoke all of my pain away 'cause that's the only thing that gon' heal it
I don't understand these women who go around pretending
As if they really fuck with me, so I love 'em all from a distance
'Cause the same bitch say she down to ride be the main one who tricking
Got Molly mixed with promethazine 'cause every time

[Chorus]
I wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind
AK-47's, MAC-11, Glocks, and nines
And all these pussy niggas hating, tryna knock me off my grind
But I can't let 'em do it, I got murder on my mind
Bitch, I got murder on my mind (Bitch, I got murder on my mind)
I got murder on my mind (On my mind)
I got murder on my mind (I got murder on my mind)
I got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind

[Verse 2]
Yellow tape around his body, it's a fucking homicide
His face is on a T-shirt and his family traumatized
I didn't even mean to shoot him, he just caught me by surprise
I reloaded my pistol, cocked it back, and shot him twice
His body dropped down to the floor and he got teardrops in his eyes
He grabbed me by my hands and said he was afraid to die
I told him it's too late, my friend, it's time to say goodbye
And he died inside my arms, blood all on my shirt

[Chorus]
Wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind
AK-47's, MAC-11, Glocks, and nines
And all these pussy niggas hating, tryna knock me off my grind

I got murder on my mind (On my mind)
I got murder on my mind
I got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind
(I got murder on my mind)

[Verse 3]
Bite like tarantula, bitch, I'm an animal
Melly's a savage, no he not no amateur
Bad bitch named Angela, fucked her on camera
Bitch I'm a murderer (Yeah, yeah)
I might just kill the boy, don't wanna kill the boy
Bake him up, say he want beef, we gon' grill the boy
(Grill the boy, we gonna grill the boy)
I'm bleeding so good, I might dip his ass in it and spill the boy

People really know you, push your buttons like typewrite
This is like a movie, but it's really very lifelike
Every single night, right, every single fight, right?
I was looking at the 'Gram and I don't even like likes
I was screamin' at my dad, he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like""
I was screamin' at the referee just like Mike
Lookin' for a bright light, Sigel, what your life like
Riding on a white bike, feeling like Excitebike (Stretch my hands to You)
Pressin' on the gas, supernova for a night light
Screamin' at my dad and he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like""
But nobody never tell you when you're being like Christ
Only ever seein' me only when they needin' me
Like if Tyler Perry made a movie for BET
Searchin' for a deity, now you wanna see it free
Now you wanna see if we, let's just see if three apiece
Tell me what your life like, turn it down, a bright light
Drivin' with my dad, and he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like"" (Stretch my hands to You)
I'm just tryna find, l've been lookin' for a new way
I'm just really tryin' not to really do the fool way
I don't have a cool way, bein' on my best, though
Block 'em on the text though, nothin' else next though
Not another word, letter, picture, or a decimal (Father, I stretch)
Wrestlin' with God, I don't really want to wrestle
Man, it's really lifelike, everything in my life (Stretch my hands to You)
Arguing with my dad, and he said, ""It ain't Christ-like""

You know, it's like
Somebody only close who can get you, like, off your

I said, ""Ahhh""

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
They fell in love one summer
A little too wild for each other
Shiny 'til it wasn't
Feels good 'til it doesn't
It was her first real lover
His too 'til he had another
Oh, God, when she found out
Trust levels went way down

[Pre-Chorus]
Of course she was sad
But now she's glad she dodged a bullet (Mm)
Took a few years to soak up the tears
But look at her now, watch her go

[Chorus]
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Look at her now, watch her go
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Wow, look at her now
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Look at her now, watch her go
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Wow, look at her now

[Post-Chorus]
Wow, look at her now

[Verse 2]
Fast nights that got him
That new life was his problem
Not saying she was perfect
Still regrets that moment
Like that night
Wasn't wrong, wasn't right, yeah
What a thing to be human (What a thing to be human)
Made her more of a woman (Made her more of a woman)

[Verse 1]
They fell in love one summer
A little too wild for each other
Shiny 'til it wasn't
Feels good 'til it doesn't
It was her first real lover
His too 'til he had another
Oh, God, when she found out
Trust levels went way down

Fast nights that got him
That new life was his problem
Not saying she was perfect
Still regrets that moment
Like that night
Wasn't wrong, wasn't right, yeah
What a thing to be human (What a thing to be human)
Made her more of a woman (Made her more of a woman)

I bow down to the King upon the throne
My life is His, I'm no longer my own
I pray to God that He'll strengthen my hand
They will think twice steppin' onto my land
I draw the line, it's written in the sand
Try me and you will see that I ain't playin'

[Verse]
""How you get so much favor on your side?""
""Accept Him as your Lord and Saviour,"" I replied
Thou shalt love thy neighbor, not divide
I'ma ride, that's on God
His light shine the brightest in the dark
Single mothers know they got my heart
And all my brothers locked up on the yard
You can still be anything you wanna be
Went from one in four to one in three
Thirteenth amendment, gotta end it, that's on me
He the new commander and the chief
That's on Keef, that's on God
Before the ranch, I had horses in the garage
When the Forbes cover was just a mirage
They had me chasin' statues, that's on pride
""Oh my God,"" Bust said that's on Tribe
When I thought the Book of Job was a job
The Devil had my soul, I can't lie
Life gon' have some lows and some highs
Before the Grammy's ever gave a nod
I wore my heart on my sleeve, I couldn't hide
In '03, they told me not to drive
I bleached my hair for every time I could've died
But I survived, that's on God
I've been tellin' y'all since '05
The greatest artist restin' or alive
That's on L.A. Reid, that's on Clive
That's no Jive, that's on God
Off the 350s He supplied
The IRS want they fifty plus our tithe
Man, that's over half of the pie
I felt dry, that's on God
That's why I charge the prices that I charge
I can't be out here dancin' with the stars
No, I cannot let my family starve
I go hard, that's on God

Ultrabeam out the solar
When I get to Heaven's gates
I ain’t gotta peak over
Keepin' perfect composure
When I scream at the chauffeur
I ain't mean, I’m just focused
I ain't mean, I'm just focused
Pour the lean out slower
Got us clean out of soda
Before the flood, people judge
They did the same thing to Noah
Everybody wanted Yandhi
Then Jesus Christ did the laundry
They say the week start on Monday
But the strong start on Sunday
Won't be in bondage to any man

We the descendants of Abraham
Ye should be made free
John 8:36
To whom the son set free is free indeed
He saved a wretch like me

Forgave my brothers and drank up
Did everything but gave up

Still we win, we prayed up
Even when we die, we raise up (Hallelujah)
Ain't no wantin', no, we need it
The powers that be done been greedy
We need ours by this evening
No white flag or no treaty
We got the product, we got the tools
We got the minds, we got the youth

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Use this gospel for protection
It's a hard road to Heaven
We call on Your blessings
In the Father, we put our faith
King of the kingdom
Our demons are tremblin'
Holy angels defendin'
In the Father, we put our faith

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
How could He not be the greatest?
In my bed, under covers when undercovers had raided
My presence is happy belated
Fashionably late, I'm just glad that you made it
The best is yet to come, I'm just glad that you waited
They all say they real 'til it's time to appraise it
I seen them come and go, you only the latest
But who am I to judge? I'm crooked as Vegas

[Chorus: Kanye West]

It's a hard road to Heaven

In the Father, we put our faith
King of the kingdom
Our demons are tremblin'
Holy angels defendin'

[Verse 2: No Malice]
A lot of damaged souls, I done damaged those
And in my arrogance, took a camera pose
Caught with a trunk of Barry Manilows
They sing a different tune when the slammer close
From the concrete grew a rose
They give you Wraith talk, I give you faith talk
Blindfolded on this road, watch me faith walk
Just hold on to your brother when his faith lost

Gotta take a deep breath, time to focus on you

But I ain't worried now, I'ma let my hair down

Cut out all the lights, He the light
Got pulled over, see the brights
What you doin' on the street at night?
Wonder if they're gonna read your rights
Thirteenth Amendment, three strikes
Made a left when I should've made a right
Told God last time on life
Told the devil that I'm going on a strike
Told the devil when I see him, on sight
I've been working for you my whole life
Told the devil that I'm going on a strike
I've been working for you my whole life
Nothing worse than a hypocrite
Change, he ain't really different
He ain't even try to get permission
Ask for advice and they dissed him
Said I'm finna do a gospel album
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'll be the first one to judge me
Make it feel like nobody love me
They'll be the first one to judge me
Feelin' like nobody love me
Told people God was my mission
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'll be the first one to judge me
Make it feel like nobody love me
Make you feel alone in the dark and you'll never see the light
Man, you're never seein' home and you never see the domes
I can feel it when I write, point of livin' in the right
If they only see the wrongs, never listen to the songs
Just to listen is a fight, but you booked me for the fight
It's so hard to get along if they only see the slight
From the love of religion
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'll be the first one to judge me
Make it seem like nobody love me
I'm not tryna lead you to Visas
But if I try to lead you to Jesus

Please, pray for me
Hold myself on death
Hold it down, all fallen down
Somebody pray for me

[Verse 1]
Now, baby
Can't tell you why, why we
Ain't getting high no more, tried so hard
There's something I've been feeling
And we're lonely
But we never used to be
Either we're arguing or you leave
We both know something's missing

I've been holding on
Holding on to nothing
You don't care too much
And it's obvious that
You're already gone
So unleash your weapon
Aim it at my chest then

You're the one with the trigger (Oh)
Shoot me down, shoot me down

[Songtext zu „Doch in der Nacht“]

[Intro]
Doch in der Nacht (uh-uh)
(Uh-uh)
Doch in der Nacht (uh-uh)

[Part 1]
Im Cabriolet (im Cabriolet)
Fahr' ich vor deine Tür
Denn du hast mir so gefehlt, gefehlt, gefehlt
Ich frag', wie's dir geht (Apache)
Du sagst nur, „Ist okay, okay, okay“
Baby, wir streiten uns zwar oft, doch ich weiß, dass du sowas brauchst
Was sich liebt, das neckt sich, also sag, wieso regst du dich auf?
Ich hab' dir nie gesagt, dass ich dich lieb', du sagst, „Ich lieb' dich auch!“
Baby, ich lauf' und lauf' und lauf'

[Pre-Hook]
Ich komm' vorbei in deine Hood
Die Tür bleibt zu, ich bleibe cool
Deine Mum schreibt, „Er tut nicht gut!
Er tut nicht gut!“

[Hook]
Doch in der Nacht
Schreist du wiedermal meinen Nam'n (Apache)
Egal, was ich mach'
Am Ende liegst du in meinen Arm'n, und du sagst:
„Baby, ich lieb' dich nicht, bild dir nichts ein
Schlag dir das ganz schnell aus deinem Kopf“
Oh Babe, ich weiß Bescheid, es ist alles frei
Und deshalb schreibst du mir so oft

[Post-Hook]
Doch in der Nacht (uh-uh)
(Uh-uh)
Doch in der Nacht (uh-uh)

[Part 2]
Im AMG
Wir sind auf dem richtigen Weg
Doch sag mir, warum weinst du Tränen, Tränen, Trän'n?
Im Nacken Siren'n, du willst mit mir reden?
Kickdown an Ampel, der Motor zu laut
Ich kann dich nicht versteh'n, versteh'n, versteh'n
Warum fickst du meinen Kopf? Ich glaube nicht, dass ich dich brauch'
Andre Mütter hab'n auch schöne Töchter, du kannst mir nicht trau'n
Und jedes Mal aufs Neue schwörst du dir, mit mir ist es jetzt aus
Ach hör doch auf, hör auf, hör auf (pshh)

[Letra de ""Cuerpo En Venta"" ft. Myke Towers, Rauw Alejandro & Almighty]

[Intro: Rauw Alejandro]
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah (¡Yo!)

[Refrán: Rauw Alejandro]
Ella ya se cansó de ser la victima
Ahora su corazón ya no lo lastiman
Se le acabaron las lágrimas (Ah-ah-ah)

[Coro: Rauw Alejandro, Almighty]
Ya no está pa' que le mientan
Puso su cuerpo en venta
Dice que el amor no existe
Que uno e' quien se lo inventa
Ya no está pa' que le mientan
Puso su cuerpo en venta (Oye, ella se puso pa'l dinero)
Dice que el amor no existe
Que uno es quien se lo inventa (Jajaja, y tú puesto pa' ella)

[Verso 1: Almighty]
Ella puso su cuerpo en una subasta, se volvió gimnasta
Ahora sólo está puesta pa'l que gasta (Cash)
No come carbohidratos, pero tú háblale de pasta (Jajaja)
Que ella quiere un Mercedes no quiere un Mazda (¡Rrr!)
Aquí los cuerno' se pegan como en la' carta' a las estampa'
La ley de vida no tiene trampa' (Jamás)
Le tiran billete' que son como la lluvia, que no escampa
Le meto hasta dejarla invalida pa' que use rampa (¡Mami!)
Tú mi puta, yo tu puto, hace su dinero porque esa es su vida
Yo no le discuto (No hay cero')
El corazón es negro porque está de luto
Y si tu mujer es stripper, no la celes, no seas bruto

[Verso 2: Noriel]
(Ah; No'-No'-Noriel)
Ya no mezcla los sentimiento' con la mente (Ajá)
Se hizo el corazón, las teta' y los diente' (¡Wuh!)
Antes le mentían, ahora ella es la que miente (Normal)
Cuando va a salir, enrola un phillie pa' entrar en ambiente
Ya no le vuelven a ver la cara (Ah)
El próximo que trate (Ah), ella jura que la' va a pagar cara' (¡Wuh!)
No ha podí'o nadie hasta la fecha, hasta Cupido se murió (Prr)
Porque ella misma le enterró la flecha (Jajaja)
Y ahora vive su vida hasta el límite (Ah)
No va a existir ningún hombre que la limite (Ah)
De to'as sus amiga' ahora ella es la élite (Ajá)
Porque no existe ninguna que la imite (¡Wuh!; No'-No'-Noriel)

[Coro: Noriel & Rauw Alejandro]
Ya no está pa' que le mientan
Puso su cuerpo en venta
Dice que el amor no existe
Que uno es quien se lo inventa
Ya no está pa' que le mientan
Puso su cuerpo en venta (Yeh)
Dice que el amor no existe
Que uno e' quien se lo inventa, yeh (Yeh)

[Verso 3: Rauw Alejandro]
Ra'-Rauw
Dejó los corazone' por el placer
Ya no busca na' enserio
Déjame entrar, olvida el ayer
Aunque piense' que soy igual que ellos (¡Yah!)
Antes se pasaba mintiéndole
Ahora se pasa vengándose
Prefiere estar solita maltratándose
Que mal acompañar a otro pegándoselas (¡Yah!)
No creé en la almas gemelas (No)
No le importa si mal te queda'
No es de nadie, hace lo que quiera, yeah-yeah

[Verso 4: Myke Towers]
Ya ella, ella no e' la víctima, ahora es la victimaría (-maría)
Tiene guille de mala (Mala), como tú he visto varia' (Varia')
Le gusta hacer posicione' imaginaria' (Imaginaria')
Pero dice que estar en 4 es la primaria (Primaria)
Y no se prostituye, pero se suelta si pagan
Y si prende no se apaga, las botellas no se acaban, baby
Y las mujere' como tú sé que son cara'
Pero la bellaquera es la que nunca nos separa
Ya no quiere mentira'
Por eso me tira y lo nuestro no expira
Y cuando tú me escriba'
Voy a estar dispuesto pa' hacer to' lo que tú diga'
Le gusta tenerme arriba

[Coro: Myke Towers & Rauw Alejandro]
Ella ya no está pa' que le mientan
Puso su cuerpo en venta

I've been holding back tears
While you're throwing back beers
I'm  alone in my bed

Guess that's why we stay the same

I'll pack my bags, get on the road
Find someone that loves you
Better than I do, darling, I know
'Cause  you remind me every day
I'm not enough, but I still stay

[Verse 1]
Boy, tell me, can you take my breath away?
Cruisin' down a heart-shaped highway
Got you swervin' lane-to-lane, don't hit the brakes
'Cause I'm feelin' so safe

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be your baby, on a Sunday
Oh, why don't we get out of town?
Call me your baby, on the same wave
Oh, no, no, there's no slowin' down

[Chorus]
You and I, I
Ridin' Harleys in Hawaii-i-i
I'm on the back, I'm holdin' tight, I
Want you to take me for a ride, ride
When I hula-hula, hula
So good, you'll take me to the jeweler-jeweler, jeweler
There's pink and purple in the sky-y-y
We're ridin' Harleys in Hawaii-i-i

[Verse 2]
Let me run my fingers through your salty hair
Go ahead, explore the island vibes
So real that you can feel it in the air
I'm revvin' up your engine

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be your baby, on a Sunday
Oh, why don't we get out of town? (Why don't we get out of town?)

[Part 1]
Sie riecht das Parfüm von andern Frau'n an sei'm Hemd
Liegt wieder mal ganz alleine im Bett
Nicht viel, was sie braucht, doch selbst das nimmt man ihr weg
Sie liebt von ganzem Herzen, auch wenn keiner es schätzt (he-heh)
Und wär sie wirklich ehrlich, wüsste sie, dass ihr Herz bricht
Doch in der Hoffnung, dass sich etwas ändert
Nimmt sie es in Kauf, in Kauf, in Kauf
Wach auf, wach auf, wach auf!

[Hook]
Wieso tust du dir das an?
Du sagst, du hältst es aus, aber wie lang noch?
Da draußen wartet safe ein echter Mann, doch
Noch nie im Leben warst du so gefang'n, Gott, es ist krank
Wieso tust du dir das an?
Ich warte immer noch auf eine Antwort
All meine Lügen hast du längst erkannt, doch
Noch nie im Leben warst du so gefang'n, Gott, es ist krank

Mein Herz, komm, reiß es raus, denn ich brauch' es nicht mehr
Schneid es auf und schau rein, Baby, ich glaub', es ist leer
Verzeih mir nicht mehr, denn das habe ich nicht verdient
Verzeih mir nicht mehr, denn das hast du nicht mehr verdient (he-heh)
Du wolltest Liebe, mehr nicht, langsam wird es gefährlich

Tell me how I'm trash and you could easily replace me
Tell me that I'm strung out, wasted on the daily
Prolly 'cause there's no one around me numbin' all my pain
Prolly 'cause there's no umbrella to shield me from all the rain
Probably because you're the one playin' the mind games
You hate me because I don't let you play no mind games
They give me migraines and damage my brain
Date me, break me, easily replace me
Hopefully you see it clear, hopefully it's HD
Bet you wonder why the last few months I've been spacey
In your head, I sing...

[Pre-Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
It's a thin line between all this love and hate
And if you switch sides, you're gon' have to claim your place
So baby, this time you're gon' have to seal your fate
Yeah baby, this time you're gon' have to seal your fate

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
And tell me how you hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me
Hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me

[Verse 2: Juice WRLD]
Hate me, hate me, tell me how you hate me
Tell me how I'm trash and you could easily replace me
Tell me that I'm strung out, wasted on the daily
Prolly 'cause there's no one around me numbin' all my pain
Prolly 'cause there's no umbrella to shield me from all the rain
Probably because you're the one playin' the mind games
You hate me because I don't let you play no mind games
They give me migraines and damage my brain
Date me, break me, easily replace me
Hopefully you see it clear, hopefully it's HD
Bet you wonder why the last few months I've been spacey
In your head, I sing...

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding with Juice WRLD]
And tell me how you hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me

[Songtext zu „Keine Liebe“]

[Hook: RIN]
Baby, sag mir, warum liebst du diesen Typ mit den Nikes?
Warum schaust du mich nicht an und gehst nur vorbei?
Warum liebst du Schmerz und gehst nicht, sondern verzeihst?
Du bist eine Bitch, doch ich glaub' nicht, dass du's weißt

[Part 1: RIN]
Gesichter sind zwei, Ringlichter dabei
Du ziehst dir auf YouTube die Tutorials rein
Du liebst Fashion Nova und verlinkst jeden Buy
Du brauchst diese Liebe und die Aufmerksamkeit
Baby, warum sticht dein Herz wie Louboutin Spikes?
Baby, warum steigst du aus dem Zug und ich ein?
Warum schreibst du auf dei'm Insta: „Alle sind gleich“?
Du siehst doch die Kippe in sei'm Mund und sagst Hi

[Pre-Hook: Bausa]
Du trägst keine Liebe in dir
Nicht für mich und für irgendwen

[Part 2: RIN]
Bilder und Likes, Bilder zu zweit
Du schaust mit ihm Netflix, doch bleibst trotzdem allein
Du bist nicht du selbst, sondern Kardashian 2
Dir fällt nichts mehr ein, dann leiht dir Drake seine Zeil'n
Baby, was bedeuten dir die Instagram Likes?
Baby, weiß denn deine Mama nicht, was du treibst?
Sag mir, warum postest du von Weeknd die Zeil'n?
Du wirst nicht Selena, egal, wie oft du weinst

Si la ve', aquí no andamo' en sentimiento
Mami, lo que quiere' e' ¡fuego!

[Verse 1: Jorja Smith]
I know you want me
Every day, not only when you're lonely‚ yeah
You see me think you know me
But you don't even know nothing about me‚ yeah
You see my thick thighs
Lost it when you look into my brown eyes
See‚ my little waist can make you switch sides
You never know the devil in the disguise
So why don't you stand up, baby, and
Tell me‚ tell me, tell me do you want me on top?
So let me show you, show you‚ show you, I don't need to back it up
Don't wanna hold ya, mold ya, scold ya
Split you in half with my heart
I just wanna love on you, trust in you, honour you
Please do the same on your part

[Chorus: Jorja Smith]
Be honest (Be honest)
You want this (You want it)
But I can be heartless
Regardless of my conscience
Be honest (Be honest)
You want this (You want it)

Regardless of my conscience

[Verse 2: Jorja Smith]
Take time, you no say I run whenever I see bad minds
Before you come my way, make sure you think twice
Look into my eyes but I can never see I
I can point a gun, but ya know I could never lie, yeah
Come through
I can show you somethin' you can run to
When I'm finished, you'll be feelin' brand new
Will never be somebody you can run through
And I can put that on my life
One time, no cap, big vibes, throw that
Catch feels, get high
If you make your bed, then you can lie
Just please don't waste my time

[Chorus: Jorja Smith]
Be honest (Be honest)

And it’s all because I’m thinking of us
Don’t throw me under the bus
Under a spell, I’m under your love
Don’t know why nobody want me

Put your hand inside my goodie bag
If I do you bad
I beg you, no make you, do me back
Give me one time, one try
Be mine, this time
Take time, same time
Make we no dey waste time
Girl I never lie you already know I'll be honest

Dadá Boladão, baby

[Refrão: Oik & NeoBeats]
Safada, como é que tem coragem de falar na minha cara
Que só faz comigo o que tu fez lá em casa?
Tava lembrando de você em cima de mim
Surtada, tada, tada, tada, tada, tada, tada
Ela é uma diaba

[Verso 1: Dadá Boladão]
Hoje eu só te quero ver pelo espelho pelada
Não me importa a hora, pode ser de madrugada
Você sabe que me amarro na sua sentada, oh
Menina levada
Sinto teu perfume quando eu tô na estrada
Como eu não resisto tua cara de safada
Fuma aqui comigo, eu quero te ver chapada, oh

[Intro: Sech, Wisin, Zion & Sech]
Hola (The Avengers)
Quiero saber tu nombre y quizá, tal vez (Otros niveles musicales; tal vez)
Algo podríamos tener, no sé (No sé)
Si me pensaste (Ah-ah), como yo te pensé (Pensé; Los Vengadores)
Fue que yo me acordé, que ayer (Que ayer), tú, uh-uh

[Pre-Coro: Feid, Wisin]
Dejaste en mi cama to'a tu ropa interior (Yeah, yeah)
Y hoy te estoy buscando pa' pasarla cabrón
No sé lo que tienes, está dura la shorty
Modela en su story (Eh-eh-eh; let's go)

[Coro: Dalex, Zion & Dalex, Zion, Wisin]
Ayer en la noche empezamo' y la disco encendi'a y tú prendi'a (Tra)
Anoche lo hicimo' en el carro y hoy ni me conocía'
Qué rico lo hacías, bebé (Z-Diddy; Ah)
Ayer en la noche empezamo' y la disco prendi'a y tú encendi'a (Tra)
Anoche lo hicimo' en el carro y hoy ni me conocía'
Qué rico lo hacía', bebé

[Verso 1: Justin Quiles]
Nosotro' haciéndolo atrá' y lo asiento' pa'l 'lante
Pega'o al volante (Yeh-yeh-yeh)
Besándome el cuello, me dice que quiere que le ponga reggaetón de ante'
Triple equi', eh (Yeah), cuando arriba la trepé (Tra)
Te tiene pensando cómo te azote
Tú me llama', y le llego a tu casa a FedEx

[Verso 2: Zion]
Yo-Yo-Yo, yo tengo una gata que me gusta
Es media masoquista y le gusta por detrá', -trá' (Tra)
Conmigo siempre bebe, pero de ve' en cuando a ella le gusta fumar (Z-Diddy; you know)
Cuando le meto (Duro), se nos forma el capsulón hasta el techo (El techo)
Yo la quiero porque es un booty nuevo (Booty nuevo)
No necesito otra más, baby por eso
¡Zion, baby!

[Coro: Lenny Tavárez, Dalex, Zion & Dalex, Wisin, *Zion*]
Ayer en la noche empezamo' y la disco encendi'a y tú prendi'a (Tra)

Qué rico lo hacías, bebé (*Z-Diddy*; Ah)
Ayer en la noche empezamo' y la disco prendi'a y tú encendi'a (Tra)
Anoche lo hicimo' en el carro y hoy ni me conocía'
Qué rico lo hacía', *bebé*

[Verso 3: Wisin]
Yeah
Dieron las doce (Oh), y entre caricias y roces
Yo hice lo que quería solo para que tú goces
Soy tu esclavo (Esclavo), dime, ¿qué hago? (¿Qué hago?)
Pero por favor no digas que no me reconoces
Porque fue mágico (Fue mágico), comer tu cuerpo exótico (Exótico)
Yo estaba enfermo de amor y tú fuiste mi antibiótico
Te mordía los labios, tú decías ""dame"" (Tú decías ""dame"")
Que te llevara al cielo y que el momento no acabé (Préndelo-préndelo)

[Verso 4: Lenny Tavárez]
Shorty, ¿cómo te va? (¿Cómo te va?)
El perfume de tu cuerpo no se me va (No se me va)
Los cristale' empeña'os por la humeda' (Wuh)
Y lo' condones en la gaveta por si se da, si se da, da
Tú eres adicta al perreo, pero más al bellaqueo (-queo)
69 posiciones y nos vemo' (No' vemo')
Tenemo' un vicio que siempre los dos queremo' (Queremo')

[Verso 5: Feid]
Otra, otra noche, otra
Llevo Varetica pa' prender, ma'
Otra, otra noche, otra
Con ese culito me jukié, yeah
Parce tiene que moverse (-se, -se)
Hoy saqué a pasear la' Jordan y la Merce' (-ce')
Bebé, ¿qué más pues?, ¿qué hay pa' hacer está tarde? (Tarde)
Pasé por el barrio antes de venir a verte (Yeah)

[Intro]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

[Verse 1]
You tell me that I'm complicated
And that might be an understatement
Anything else? (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
You tell me that I'm indecisive
Fickle, but I try to hide it
Anything else? (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
You tell me that I overthink
'Til I ruin a good thing
Anything else? (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
You tell me that you'd rather fight
Than spend a single peaceful night
With somebody else (Ha-ha-ha-ha)

[Pre-Chorus]
You really, really know me
The future and the old me
All of the mazes and the madness in my mind
You really, really love me
You know me and you love me
And it's the kind of thing I always hoped I'd find (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy
Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy
Touch me 'til I find myself, in a feeling
Tell me with your hands that you're never leaving (No)
Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy (Seem so easy)

[Verse 2]
I never liked my crooked teeth
You tell me they're your favorite thing (Mm-hmm)
Anything else? (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
The stretch marks all around my thighs
Kiss 'em 'til I change my mind
About everything else (Ha-ha-ha-ha)

[Pre-Chorus]
You really, really know me
The future and the old me
All of the mazes and the madness in my mind
You really, really love me (You really, really love me)
You know me and you love me (Uh, huh)
And it's the kind of thing I always hoped I'd find

[Chorus]
Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy (So easy, yeah)
Always thought I was hard to love (To love)
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy (So easy, yeah)
Touch me 'til I find myself, in a feeling (Oh)
Tell me with your hands that you're never leaving (Oh, never)
Always thought I was hard to love (To love)
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy (Oh)

[Bridge]
All I know is you, heal me when I'm broken, heal me when I'm broken, oh
All I know is you, saved me and you know it, saved me and you know it (Saved me and you know it)

[Chorus]
Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy (Ah)
I always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy ('Til you made it, 'til you made it)

You know me and you love me
And it's the kind of thing I always hoped I'd find (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy
Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy
Touch me 'til I find myself, in a feeling
Tell me with your hands that you're never leaving (No)
Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy (Seem so easy)

[Verse 2]
I never liked my crooked teeth
You tell me they're your favorite thing (Mm-hmm)
Anything else? (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
The stretch marks all around my thighs
Kiss 'em 'til I change my mind
About everything else (Ha-ha-ha-ha)

[Pre-Chorus]
You really, really know me
The future and the old me
All of the mazes and the madness in my mind
You really, really love me (You really, really love me)
You know me and you love me (Uh, huh)
And it's the kind of thing I always hoped I'd find

[Chorus]
Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy (So easy, yeah)
Always thought I was hard to love (To love)
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy (So easy, yeah)
Touch me 'til I find myself, in a feeling (Oh)
Tell me with your hands that you're never leaving (Oh, never)
Always thought I was hard to love (To love)
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy (Oh)

[Bridge]
All I know is you, heal me when I'm broken, heal me when I'm broken, oh
All I know is you, saved me and you know it, saved me and you know it (Saved me and you know it)

[Chorus]
Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy (Ah)
I always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy ('Til you made it, 'til you made it)
Touch me 'til I find myself, in a feeling (A feeling)
Tell me with your hands that you're never leaving (Tell me with your hands that you're...)
Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy (Seem so easy)

[Part 1: Ezhel]
Kıza bak, bakakaldım, tatlı, sanki baklava
Kimseye güvenemem, alayınız Backstabber
İki kez, üç kez olsa, tamam eyvallah, tamam
Daha ölmedik ama dolu etraf akbaba
Postuna mâl olabilir dönüşmek Rockstar'a
Sokak Rap militanı gibi girdim çat kapı
Ama bu sokak farklı, bur'da derler: ""Sackgasse""
Avrupa ortasında oynatırız farfara
Tam yarana bıçağım, kafana sıça'm
İntikam, başka bi' zaman, dökemem şimdi kan
U-F-O, bölge elli bir, Area 51
Bilgilen keke, bizi çal, biziz ichiban (ichiban)

[Hook: Ezhel & Ufo361]
Wir sind Kral (Kral, Kral, oh)
Wir sind Kral (wir sind Kral)
Wir sind Kral (wir sind Kral, ihr wisst Bescheid)
Wir sind Kral (wir sind Kral, Stay High)

[Part 2: Ufo361, Ezhel]
Wir sind Kral, wir sind überall (wir sind Kral), Krone voll Juwel'n
Ja, sie drippt (drippt), Soße Hollandaise, geh uns aus dem Weg
Ihr seid urgh, wir sind haa, ihr seid lame, wir sind fast
Ihr seid Bauern, wir sind Kral, das sind Facts, no Offense

Wir sind Lions, Dicka, ihr seid nur Cats (Cats)
Geh zur Seite, ja, sonst wirst du verletzt (ha, ha)

I feel like I'm Gucci Mane in 2006

Make no sense, nah, it make no sense, slime

And you know me, bitch, I just bought another 30 burner (30 burner)
I whip too hard, so I got Ike and Meech, got Tina Turner (Whippin' hard)
It don't make sense, I’m not alright, bitch, I'll put you under
I ain't cut too much, I got that shit that make 'em tweak like damn
Can't be in front the trap too much, the world know who I am (I am)
This shit ain't sweet, who close to me, I see 'em hatin' like damn
All I know get the money, still gon’ be the one to slay ’em

That's a bar, real nigga blessed him with that bar and he say yeah-eah
He out the H, you play, he shoot you in your face (Northside)

Hey

[Chorus: Camila Cabello & Pharrell Williams]
Havana, ooh na-na (Ayy)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh na-na (Ayy, ayy)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na, ah
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (Ayy)
There's somethin' 'bout his manners (Uh-huh)
Havana, ooh na-na (Uh)

[Verse 1: Camila Cabello & Pharrell Williams]
He didn't walk up with that ""how you doin'?"" (Uh)
When he came in the room
He said there's a lot of girls I can do with (Uh)
But I can't without you
I knew him forever in a minute (Hey)
That summer night in June
And papa says he got malo in him (Uh)
He got me feelin' like...

[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello & Pharrell Williams]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Ayy)
I knew it when I met him (Ayy), I loved him when I left him
Got me feelin' like, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
And then I had to tell him, I had to go
Oh na-na-na-na-na (Woo)

[Chorus: Camila Cabello & Pharrell Williams]
Havana, ooh na-na (Ayy, hey)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh na-na (Ayy, ayy, uh-huh)

Oh, but my heart is in Havana (Huh)
My heart is in Havana (Ayy)
Havana, ooh na-na

(Jeffery)
Just graduated, fresh on campus, mmm
Fresh out East Atlanta with no manners, damn (Fresh out East Atlanta)
Bump on her bumper like a traffic jam
Hey, I was quick to pay that girl like Uncle Sam (Here you go, ayy)
Back it on me (Back it up)
Shawty cravin' on me, get to eatin' on me (On me)
She waited on me (And what?)
Shawty cakin' on me, got the bacon on me (Wait up)
This is history in the makin', homie (Homie)
Point blank, close range, that B (Tah, tah)
If it cost a million, that's me (That's me)
I was gettin' mula, baby

[Chorus: Camila Cabello & Pharrell Williams]
Havana, ooh na-na (Ayy, ayy)

Someone said they left together
I ran out the door to get her
She was holding hands with Trevor
Not the greatest feeling ever
Said, ""Pull yourself together
You should try your luck with Heather""
Then I heard they slept together
Oh, the less I know the better
The less I know the better

[Chorus 1]
Oh my love, can't you see yourself by my side?
No surprise when you're on his shoulder like every night
Oh my love, can't you see that you're on my mind
Don't suppose we could convince your lover to change his mind
So goodbye

[Verse 2]
She said, ""It's not now or never
Wait ten years, we'll be together""
I said, ""Better late than never

I dive in it like a sailor, I love to nail her
Addicted to her paraphernalia, I had to tell her
I see it like a fortune teller
Your ex-nigga did good, I could do better
Bad bitch from the woods, I think she a hunter
She a killer and an eater, she a Jeffrey Dahmer
I can tell when she in her feelings, I can read her like a book

Are you over me? (Uh)

[Intro]
Hmm-hmm, hey

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you look so happy walking down the street, don't you, babe? (Don't you, babe?)
Did you forget, you said that in this lifetime you could never get over me?
Are you over me? (Uh)

[Pre-Chorus]
When I said I hope you're happy, didn't mean it
Never thought you'd be so good at moving on (On)
When I'm lying wide awake, you're probably sleeping (Ha)
And maybe what I'm thinking is wrong

[Chorus]
I want you to cry for me, cry for me
Say you'd d-d-die for me, die for me
And if you can't, then baby, lie for me, lie for me (Huh)
'Cause you haunt me when I'm dreamin'
And it's time you know the feeling
So cry for me

[Verse 2]
See that pretty life in pictures (Ha)
See her lips erasing me (Mm)
You're so good to her, it's vicious
Yeah, she should be thanking me
Who, who's gonna touch you like me?
Yeah, tell me, who?
Who can make you forget about me? (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
When I said I hope you're happy, didn't mean it (Didn't mean it, yeah)
Never thought you'd be so good at moving on (On, on)
When I'm lying wide awake, you're probably sleeping (Sleeping)
And maybe what I'm thinking is wrong

[Chorus]
I want you to cry for me, cry for me
Say you'd d-d-die for me, die for me
And if you can't, then baby, lie for me, lie for me (Lie)
'Cause you haunt me when I'm dreamin'
And it's time you know the feeling
So, baby, won't you cry for me, cry for me? (Cry for me)
Say you'd d-d-die for me, die for me (Oh, won't you cry?)
And if you can't, then baby, lie for me, lie for me
'Cause you haunt me when I'm dreamin'
And it's time you know the feeling
So cry for me

[Bridge]
Why won't you cry?
Tears in my eyes, yeah
And you're okay, you're okay
How can you be okay?
No, why won't you cry?

[Chorus]
I want you to cry for me, cry for me (Oh, yeah)
Say you'd d-d-die for me, die for me (Me)
And if you can't, then baby, lie for me, lie for me
(Baby, lie for me, lie for me)
'Cause you haunt me when I'm dreamin'
(Haunt me when I'm dreamin')
And it's time you know the feeling
(And it's time you know the feeling)
So, baby, won't you cry for me, cry for me? (Cry out, yeah)
Say you'd d-d-die for me, die for me (Cry out, yeah)
And if you can't, then baby, lie for me, lie for me
'Cause you haunt me when I'm dreamin'
And it's time you know the feeling (Oh, baby)
So cry for me

[Chorus]
Don't tell me this is all for nothin'
I can only tell you one thing
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere
I see everything you can be
I see the beauty that you can't see
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere

[Verse 1]
I could've showed you all the scars at the start
But that was always the most difficult part
See, I'm in love with how your soul's a mix of chaos and art
And how you never try to keep 'em apart (Yeah)
I wrote some words and then I stared at my feet
Became a coward when I needed to speak
I guess love took on a different kind of meaning for me
So when I go, just know it kills me to leave

[Pre-Chorus]
To all the stars that light the road
Don't ever leave that girl so cold
Never let me down, just lead me home

[Chorus]
Don't tell me this is all for nothin'
I can only tell you one thing
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere
I see everything you can be
I see the beauty that you can't see
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere

[Verse 2]
But there's beauty here that's yet to depart
There's still a song inside the halls in the dark (Halls in the dark)
I'll come for you if you just stay where you are
And I'll always hold your hand in the car (Hand in the car)
There'll be days when it's difficult
But I ask you to never leave behind the reciprocal, we're past that
Love is not designed for the cynical
So we have that (We have that)
We can have that

[Pre-Chorus]
To all the stars that light the road
Don't ever leave that girl so cold
Never let me down, just lead me home

[Chorus]
Don't tell me this is all for nothin'
I can only tell you one thing
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere
I see everything you can be
I see the beauty that you can't see
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere

[Bridge]
How long can you wait for the one you deserve?
Fight on, never let it out, never let it out
If I'm gone, if you ever leave I hope that you learn
To fight on, to fight on

[Chorus]
Don't tell me this is all for nothin'
I can only tell you one thing

Baby, I'll be out there somewhere

[Songtext zu „Berlin lebt wie nie zuvor“]

[Intro: Samra]
Wuah, rrah

[Part 1: Samra]
Kafa, Kafa, Grey Goose, Level Mashkal
Drei, vier Banuts, ich behandel' sie wie Abfall
Voll von Vision'n, sie fall'n mir in der Nacht ein (wuah)
Herzen sind schwarz, weil Soldaten in der Schlacht fall'n (rrah)
Zwanzig Mille und der neue Givenchy-Duft
Im Handschuhfach, wie mir der Anzug passt (pah, pah, pah)
Baller' Weiber im Designer-Camouflage-Jogger weg (brr)
Komm, ich zeig' dir in der Kneipe, wie ein Barhocker schmeckt (wuah)
Der Beamte am Boden, auch wenn er gut mit dem Schlagstock ist
Keine Gnade wie der blutige Pfad Gottes
Denn ich geh' über Leichen wie der Drecksstaat
Marlboro Rot und die Herzen sind pechschwarz (brraa)

[Hook: Capital Bra & Samra, Capital Bra, Samra]
All die Preise und Awards
Capi, komm, noch ein weiterer Rekord
Samra, Bra, ich glaub', wir sind dafür gebor'n
Und wir knacken den Tresor, Berlin lebt wie nie zuvor!
Rrah, all die Preise und Awards
Capi, komm, noch ein weiterer Rekord
Samra, Bra, ich glaub', wir sind dafür gebor'n
Und wir knacken den Tresor, Berlin lebt wie nie zuvor! (Rrah)

[Part 2: Capital Bra]
Bra, ich fahr' mit Wumme aufn Spielplatz (uff)
Mit Ukros und Zigans, Mardallis und Shqiptars (selam)
Bratans vom Balkan, Berlin, Pink Panther (jebo majku)
Ein Berliner fickt dreihundert von Sparta (rrah)
Ab-Abschiebehaft, A8-Schiebedach
Albträume, Knastzäune, trotzdem hab'n wir viel gelacht (haha)

[Intro: Samra]
Wuah, rrah

[Part 1: Samra]
Kafa, Kafa, Grey Goose, Level Mashkal
Drei, vier Banuts, ich behandel' sie wie Abfall
Voll von Vision'n, sie fall'n mir in der Nacht ein (wuah)
Herzen sind schwarz, weil Soldaten in der Schlacht fall'n (rrah)
Zwanzig Mille und der neue Givenchy-Duft
Im Handschuhfach, wie mir der Anzug passt (pah, pah, pah)
Baller' Weiber im Designer-Camouflage-Jogger weg (brr)
Komm, ich zeig' dir in der Kneipe, wie ein Barhocker schmeckt (wuah)
Der Beamte am Boden, auch wenn er gut mit dem Schlagstock ist
Keine Gnade wie der blutige Pfad Gottes
Denn ich geh' über Leichen wie der Drecksstaat
Marlboro Rot und die Herzen sind pechschwarz (brraa)

[Hook: Capital Bra & Samra, Capital Bra, Samra]
All die Preise und Awards
Capi, komm, noch ein weiterer Rekord
Samra, Bra, ich glaub', wir sind dafür gebor'n
Und wir knacken den Tresor, Berlin lebt wie nie zuvor!
Rrah, all die Preise und Awards
Capi, komm, noch ein weiterer Rekord
Samra, Bra, ich glaub', wir sind dafür gebor'n
Und wir knacken den Tresor, Berlin lebt wie nie zuvor! (Rrah)

[Part 2: Capital Bra]
Bra, ich fahr' mit Wumme aufn Spielplatz (uff)
Mit Ukros und Zigans, Mardallis und Shqiptars (selam)
Bratans vom Balkan, Berlin, Pink Panther (jebo majku)
Ein Berliner fickt dreihundert von Sparta (rrah)
Ab-Abschiebehaft, A8-Schiebedach
Albträume, Knastzäune, trotzdem hab'n wir viel gelacht (haha)
Zwei Schüsse fall'n, durch die Decke kommen rote Tropfen (bam, bam)
Alle unsre Feinde werden unterworfen (ja)

A lifestyle, you should try it
So 시작해, make it last, front to back, yeah, yeah

The roof's on fire, let it burn to an ash
We gon' keep it jopping, tell the DJ, “Bring it back now""

Mustard on the beat, ho

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
I put the new Forgis on the Jeep
I trap until the bloody bottoms is underneath
'Cause all my niggas got it out the streets
I keep a hundred racks inside my jeans
I remember hittin' the mall with the whole team
Now a nigga can't answer calls 'cause I'm ballin'
I was wakin' up, gettin' racks in the morning
I was broke, now I'm rich, these niggas salty

[Verse 1: Roddy Ricch]
All these designer on my body got me drip, drip, ayy
Straight up out the Yajects, I'm a big Crip
If I got a pint of lean, I'ma sip, sip
I run the racks up with my queen like London and Nip
But I got rich on all these niggas, I didn't forget, back
I had to go through the struggle, I didn't forget that
I hop inside of the Maybach and now I can sit back
These bitches know me now 'cause I got them big racks
'Cause I'm gettin' money now, I know you heard that
Young nigga on the corner, bitch, I had to serve crack
Uncle fronted me some P's, had to get them birds back
We came up on dirty money, I gave it a birdbath
Cut off the brain and I give my bitch a new coupe
Either you from the Yah Gang or you're SuWoop
Got a New Orleans bitch and man, that pussy voodoo
And I'm that nigga now, who knew?

Got a bad bitch, her ass tatted, woah, woah
Givenchy to my toes, two twins, I'm fucking 'em both
I put in a new AP, the water like a boat
I was down bad on my dick, where was you niggas at?
I know you turned your back on me just to get some racks
I see you swerve back, 'cause I'm in the black 'Bach
New diamonds on me, fuck a flash, this ain't Snapchat
'Cause I been gettin' paid
Yellow diamonds on me look like lemonade
Grab my baby mama that new Bentayga
Tryna get the dojo like a sensei, yeah
Rolls Royce umbrellas when I'm in the rain
I just mind my business
I got brothers that did the time, I ain't kiddin'

[Intro]
Run that back, Turbo

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
You can get the biggest Chanel bag in the store if you want it
I gave 'em the drip, they sucked it up, I got 'em moanin'
I bought a new Patek, I had the watch, so I two-toned 'em
Takin' these drugs, I'm gon' be up until the mornin'
That ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it
If I'm in the club, I got that fire when I'm performin'
The backend just came in, in all hundreds
Vibes galore, cute shit, they all on us
I'm from Atlanta where young niggas run shit
I know they hatin' on me, but I don't read comments
Whenever I tell her to come, she comin'
Whenever it's smoke, we ain't runnin'

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Yeah, every other night, another dollar gettin' made
Every other night started with a good day
I feel like a child, I got boogers in the face
Diamonds dancin' in the dark like this shit is a parade
I don't want your chain, Young GonWunna not a slave
I had to draw the line, too many bitches gettin' saved
TSA harass me, so I took a private plane
These pussy niggas lackin', why I'm workin' on my aim
Drip too hard (Too hard), charge it to the card (To the card)
Designer to the ground, I can barely spell the names
Drip too hard, caution on the floor
You gon' fuck around and drown tryna ride a nigga wave

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid

And that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends
It was nice to meet them

That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder

[Verse 1: Andrew Taggart]
Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much
And that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends
It was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

[Pre-Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

[Post-Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

[Verse 2: Halsey]
You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no call
Now I'm lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Halsey]
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

[Intro]
You know everybody been waiting on that Baby, man
I mean, it's like ever since Baby on Baby dropped, man, like, you know (Ever since Baby on Baby dropped)
Ain't nobody drop shit (Oh Lord, Jetson made another one)
Let's go, hah

[Chorus]
I needed some shit with some bop in it (Let's go)
I flew past the whip with that blunt in my mouth
Watch the swervin', that whip had a cop in it (Woo)
My bitch got good pussy, fly her 'cross the country
I finish the show and I hop in it
I got me a milli', I did it legit-ly
I'm still with the shits, I'm a hot nigga (Hot)

Oh, you asking for pictures with niggas? (Huh?)
What's your name? Get the fuck out the spot, nigga (Get the fuck)
Tryna figure which deal I'ma take (Uh-huh)
I woke up, couple mil' on my plate (Let's eat)
I'm investing in real and estate (Uh-huh)
I just went gave my mama a hundred (A hundred)
Probably won't hear me open my mouth 'less you hearin' me talkin' 'bout finding some money (Let's go)
As soon as I found it, I flipped that (Flip)
I'm a little bit different, they get it (They dig)
Know I'm stiff on a bitch and she dig it
Tryna find out why Baby ain't all in her mentions (Hah)
No, she ain't get no DM from me (Bitch)
This rich nigga dick, it ain't free
She be throwin' that ass, yeah, she good at it
Turn around when we fuck, make her look at it (Uh, she like, hah)

Niggas ain't fuckin' with me
And ain't 'bout what the fuck they be rappin' 'bout with they lil' scary ass (Hah)
But to each his own, nigga (Huh)
If you like it, I love it, no biggie (No big)
That boy say he get money, oh, really?
How much they just cut you a check for? A milli'
I'm going back to Cali like Biggie (Go back)
'Bout to go get a pound just to smoke (I smoke)
They told me to come work on my album
I'm tryna go find out the price on a boat (Okay)
My lil' bitch act like Megan Thee Stallion
She ghetto and nasty, she drivin' the boat (Drive the boat)

Now we comin' through the back, we don't go to the concierge (Yeah, hey-hey)
Now that boy run fashion, Cardi in that Fashion Nova gear (Ha)
We started the wave, now everybody lookin' the same
Tell me how you want it (Woah)
Shorty buss it down, give us the money, keep the crown
Tell me how you want it
I been around the globe in the Global Express
Ten O's in my net worth, yeah (Huh)
Neck work, then the leg work (Work)
We're the stars like the network (Work, Montana)

You see the writing on the wall
Hold onto me and I'ma hold ya
You see the writing on the wall
I'll bring it back, bring it back, yeah

Got a lil' mama in my telephone, she jumpin' all up on me yo (Ayy)
Hoes all in my section, I don't want 'em, kick them bitches out like vamanos (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
We can work it out, lil' mama, all we need is just a little cardio (Ayy)
Yeah, she the type of woman if we cannot do it, I will catch a body for (Ooh yeah, yeah)
Call my accountant, bought my bitch new Beamer, she whip 7-Series, yeah (Ooh yeah, yeah)
I spend whatever, girl, I do whatever to show you I'm serious (Ooh yeah, yeah)
That sound familiar, they just talkin' shit because they feel inferior

Bitches hella jealous, wishin' it was them instead of us

Standin' ovation, the broad of the nation
Me and babe racin' Wraiths, we're adjacent
Wish that we could take the rumors to the bank (To the bank)
We don't have no more room inside the safe (Woo, woo)
But I'ma ball it like a napkin, tap it like it's Jazz-feet
Hold the door for me, then pop me on the ass cheek
Ain't too rich to get it poppin' in the backseat
Next time you want another bitch, you better ask me, ah
Ike and Tina that ass, you better take a bitch you know
Show my name and this pass
And now we're rollin' down the freeway, talkin' 'bout a threeway
Startin' workin' out, but he gon' eat me on his cheat-day off

[Intro: Maluma & J Balvin]
Maluma, baby (Yeah, yeah)
J Balvin
Colombia, esto es pa' ustedes
Ella está solita y yo ando solo
Ella dice que sabe quién soy, pero no la conozco
Hoy se puso bonita pa' que yo la viera
Y me dice que si la recuerdo, hacemo' lo que quiera, yeah

[Pre-Coro: Maluma]
Acércate, acércate un poco más
Que así de lejos no logramos na'
Si te pegas, puedes ayudar a que yo te recuerde
Acércate, acércate un poco más
Que así de lejos no logramos na'
Si te pegas, puedes ayudar a que yo te recuerde

[Coro: J Balvin & Maluma]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ey, qué pena
Tu nombre no, pero tu cara me suena
Salgamos ya de este dilema
Que yo no lo recuerde no te quita la buena
Ey, qué pena
Tu nombre no, pero tu cara me suena
Salgamos ya de este dilema
De todas las chimbitas, tú eres la más buena

[Verso 1: J Balvin]
Disculpa que no te recuerde
Pero tu amiga ya me dijo todo y tengo la verde
No me enamoro porque el que se enamora pierde
¿Entonces, viniste acá solo para verme?

[Puente: J Balvin]
Me tienes gana' y de lejos se ve
Súbele al bajo pa' poder meterle
Con un bla-bla-bla pa' que yo me acuerde
Pa' mí todo' los días son vierne', yeah
Me tienes gana' y de lejos se ve
Súbele al bajo pa' poder meterle
Con un blah-blah-blah pa' que yo me acuerde
Pa' mí todo' los días son vierne'

Salgamos ya de este dilema

Ey, qué pena
Tu nombre no, pero tu cara me suena
Salgamos ya de este dilema
Que yo no lo recuerde no te quita la buena

[Verso 2: Maluma]
Algo tomé esa noche que dañó mi mente
Quedé loco, inconsciente
No significa que porque no te recuerde
No me alegra volver a verte
Yo soy curioso y eso tú lo sabes
Hoy yo estoy puesto para hacer maldades
Tu nombre bien no lo recuerdo
Pero esta noche me lo aprendo

[Pre-Coro: Maluma]
Acércate, acércate un poco más
Que así de lejos no logramos na'
Si te pegas, puedes ayudar a que yo te recuerde
Acércate, acércate un poco más

'Til we both give in to love

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Everybody needs a place to hide
This don't have to be a bumpy ride
I think we should be alone tonight
'Cause we don't have to be lonely
Everybody needs some company
Let's talk about it over one more drink
I think you should be alone with me
'Cause we don't have to be lonely

[Drop: Joe Jonas]
Don't have to be lonely, lonely
Don't have to be lonely
Don't have to be lonely
Don't have to be lonely

[Outro: Joe Jonas, Nick Jonas]
Wanna ride with you 'til the wheels fall off
'Til we're running out of road

[Chorus: DaBaby]
They said they want some of that raw shit (Raw)
Turn it up, I'ma sit in the car, bitch (Turn me up, Tahj Money)
If you turn off your lights, you gon' see me at night
Ho, you know I'm a motherfucking star, bitch (Bling)
How I know you ain't from where I'm from?
'Cause you know you can't go leave your gun in the car, dick (The fuck?)
Nigga like me walk down on your ass
Leave you stuck in the sand like a motherfuckin' starfish (Let's go)

[Verse 1: DaBaby]
Where the Backwoods at? I'm tryna smoke some' (Let's go)
STG, swear to God they don't want none' (Hah)
STD, play with fire, I'ma burn something
Back to back in Scatpack doing donuts (Skrrt)
Starting not to get head 'til I want some
She eat up the two-ball, the screwball like ice cream (Ice cream)
Who you know wear designer with Nike? (Me)
I smile and I show off my dimples, I'm icy (Cheese)
Name a label that's fucking with my team (My team)
Somebody come give me a challenge, excite me (Come on)
Nigga better stay 'way from that water
I let this bitch off, it's gon' hit you like lightning (Hah, boom)
How the fuck they let Baby go platinum?
I thought he was wack and they didn't even like him (Hah, bitch)
You can come see my plaque on my wall
Walkin' 'round in my drawers, talking shit in my castle (Uh-huh)
Think he sick, wipe his nose, I'm a nappy (Sick)
Take his bitch, that's my ho, I'm her daddy (Her dad)
Ship the shit to your door, send the addy (Your door)
Mix it in with the low, doesn't matter (Uh, low)
Nigga know I was having that remix (Yeah)
I play pussy and burn you, that's defense (Bitch)
Baby pull out my dick and she eat it
She like how I be kicking that street shit
That's your boy, he aight, he ain't me, bitch (Bitch)
Check me out on your screen, BET, bitch (Yeah)
Know I got the whole gang in LA (The gang)
I'm strapped up with that thang in LA (Uh, huh?)
I hop off the plane and I skate
She 'bout to come bring me some brain, that's my bae (My bae)
I can't go back and forth with a ho
Like a bitch who gon' do everything that I say (Shh, Quavo)

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Say they want some of that trap talk (Trap)
I get a brick, let it moonwalk (Brick)
The K shoot silent, but it still talk (Rrah)
Smoke with the pilot in the skybox (Uh)
The Culinan came with a umbrella (Skrrt)
Baguettes, no prongs, they stayin' together (Ice)

Ain't tryna brag or boast or tell 'em something they don't know

Metal on me all time (Brr)
Beefing with metal detectors and magnets (Brr)

[Verse 1: j-hope]
From 광주 한 거시기의 gang, ayy
금남 충장 street 거긴 내 할렘
뉴런 입단 bounce with my team, ayy
춤에 뻑 가 워커홀릭 매일, ayy
십대에 밤 새우며 성장한 case, ayy
내 키는 춤으로 매겨 I'm okay, ayy
큰 비전 그려나가는 plan
꿈을 그려가는 애 리듬 지르밟는 스텝, ayy
Popping, rocking, hopping, tutting, dougie, flexing, swaggin' (Woah)
아직 매일 같이 한시바삐 하지 날 위한 일 (Woah)
늘 나를 채찍해 당근은 트로피에
인생에 베팅해 춤은 나의 cash
Hope on the street 이제 나만의 길
With Becky G on the side
Everyday I'm lit (Get it!)

[Pre-Chorus: Becky G]
We always got love
For where we come from
So let 'em know what’s up, ooh
No matter wherever we go
Bring it back to this place called home, babe
Now that you know it
Let me see you (Ooh, ooh, ooh, what, what)

[Chorus: Becky G & j-hope]

Chicken noodle soup
Chicken noodle soup with a soda on the side

Chicken noodle, o pollo con espagueti
Ninguna de estas mujeres tiene el flow que tiene Becky
Latinoamericana, soy de aquí
Carita de santa, pero freaky
¿Quién me va a decir si ya to' lo vi? (Huh)
Donde yo nací no pensaban que una mujer iba a sobresalir
What you gonna do, what you gonna do? (What, what?)
What you gonna do, what you gonna do? (What, what?)
What you gonna do, what you gonna do? (What, what?)
What you gonna do, what you gonna do
Look back at it, lights, camera, action
Definitivamente la mejor de la escena
Word on the street we got the people reactin'
La gente que critica simplemente me dan pena, haha

[Pre-Chorus: Becky G]
We always got love (Got love)
For where we come from (Where we from)
So let 'em know what's up (Ooh, yeah)
No matter wherever we go
Bring it back to this place called home, baby
Now that you know it
Let me see you (Ooh, ooh, ooh, what what?)

From 광주 한 거시기의 gang, ayy
금남 충장 street 거긴 내 할렘
뉴런 입단 bounce with my team, ayy
춤에 뻑 가 워커홀릭 매일, ayy
십대에 밤 새우며 성장한 case, ayy
내 키는 춤으로 매겨 I'm okay, ayy
큰 비전 그려나가는 plan
꿈을 그려가는 애 리듬 지르밟는 스텝, ayy
Popping, rocking, hopping, tutting, dougie, flexing, swaggin' (Woah)
아직 매일 같이 한시바삐 하지 날 위한 일 (Woah)
늘 나를 채찍해 당근은 트로피에
인생에 베팅해 춤은 나의 cash
Hope on the street 이제 나만의 길
With Becky G on the side
Everyday I'm lit (Get it!)

[Pre-Chorus: Becky G]
We always got love

No matter wherever we go
Bring it back to this place called home, babe

What you gonna do, what you gonna do? (What, what?)
What you gonna do, what you gonna do? (What, what?)
What you gonna do, what you gonna do? (What, what?)
What you gonna do, what you gonna do
Look back at it, lights, camera, action

My heart so cold I think I'm done with ice (Uh, brr)
Said if I leave her, she gon' die
Well, bitch, you done with life (Okay)
Better not pull up with no knife
'Cause I bring guns to fights (Boom)
Say you got that sack, I got that sack
But ain't no ones in mine (Nope)

I don't even like dubs in mine (Alright)

What I look like with all this money? (Huh?)
How I look havin' all these hoes? (Uh)

Yeah, I'm talkin' diamonds, froze (Yeah)
Came from the bottom, toes (Woah, Kenny)

Yeah, backend Baby (A hundred)
That's what they pay me a show (Let's go)
That's probably some cap in my rap
By the time this shit drop, they gon' pay me some more (Uh-huh)
And I still can go back to the trap
Send a box, pick it up, make a play at the store

She let me put it in the back of her throat
Walk in the bank with a M in a tote (Yeah)
I'm tryna make a deposit
Let 'em try play with the money (Pow, pow)
Shawty gon' take off your noggin
Long as she want it and pick it, I'm buyin' it

I get 'em whacked, I don't advise 'em to try it, yeah

Ain’t no Minute Maid

Flexin' hard, call me Popeye
Wallet filled with spinach, ayy
Cut you off on the interstate
I’m first to finish, ayy

Bitch it’s always been that way
To the grave, might just be tomorrow
Might just be today
So I always live it up
We poppin' bottles
Poppin' K's
Gucci shades from my bougie bitch
I ain’t even had to pay
Had to put on for the team
And had to put on for the Bay
I'm still fly when I wear robins wings
I can’t stay in one place
Russian Creams in my rocket ship
We go to outer space
Mask off, mask on, fuck it
I can’t catch a case
Blast off, blast off
See the stars up in Wraith

Because the mansion got a gate
You can't come into my section

[Chorus]
I don’t want a valentine
I just want Valentino
I just want the neck
I poker face like a casino
Deep throat
Know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some mo'
She just can’t seem to keep her knees closed
I don’t want a valentine
I just want Valentino
I just want the neck
I poker face like a casino
Deep throat
Know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some mo'
She just can’t seem to keep her knees closed

[Verse]
I fuck her long
Ain’t no Minute Maid
My diamonds lemonade
Flexin' hard, call me Popeye
Wallet filled with spinach, ayy
Cut you off on the interstate
I’m first to finish, ayy
I’m a young rich nigga
Bitch it’s always been that way
To the grave, might just be tomorrow
Might just be today
So I always live it up
We poppin' bottles
Poppin' K's
Gucci shades from my bougie bitch
I ain’t even had to pay
Had to put on for the team
And had to put on for the Bay
I'm still fly when I wear robins wings
I can’t stay in one place
Russian Creams in my rocket ship
We go to outer space
Mask off, mask on, fuck it
I can’t catch a case
Blast off, blast off
See the stars up in Wraith
You can't get into the crib
Because the mansion got a gate
You can't come into my section
I’m gon' put you in your place
If your club goin' up
You bet I’m sliding like it's chess
And I think I fell in love
She shook that ass up in my face

[Chorus]
I don’t want a valentine
I just want Valentino
I just want the neck
I poker face like a casino
Deep throat
Know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some mo'
She just can’t seem to keep her knees closed
I don’t want a valentine
I just want Valentino
I just want the neck
I poker face like a casino
Deep throat
Know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some mo'
She just can’t seem to keep her knees closed
(She just can’t seem to keep her knees closed)
(She just can’t seem to keep her knees closed)

I don’t want a valentine
I just want Valentino
I just want the neck
I poker face like a casino
Deep throat
Know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some mo'
She just can’t seem to keep her knees closed
I don’t want a valentine
I just want Valentino
I just want the neck
I poker face like a casino
Deep throat
Know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some mo'
She just can’t seem to keep her knees closed

[Intro]
Ja, ja, ja, ja
Ja, ja, ja
Ey, Jungs, könnt ihr die Tür zumachen?
This is the world that you know
Minh macht voll die Hits (oh, Junge)

[Hook]
Ich bin down mit meinen Brüdern an 'nem Montag (wouh)
Dieses Leben glitzert wie ein Fabergé (Space)
Scheiß' auf alles, denn wir chill'n den ganzen Monat (Glitzer, Glitzer, Glitzer)
Bevor wir sterben, bitte schieß ein Portrait
Ich bin down mit meinen Brüdern an 'nem Montag (oh, Junge)
Dieses Leben glitzert wie ein Fabergé (Space)
Eine Träne rollt für was wir so verlor'n hab'n (Glitzer, Glitzer, Glitzer)
Bevor wir sterben, bitte schieß ein Portrait (ey)

[Part 1]
Meine Tasche aus Paris, sie ist von Goyard (Goyard, Goyard)
Mix' Designer mit dem 'Preme und auch dem Flohmarkt (Goyard)
Flipp' das ganze Game, obwohl wir immer stoned war'n (stoned)
Unser Leben wie ein Film – Anime
Außerirdisch – Anunnaki (wouh)

Leben schnell (wouh), Kawasaki (ey)

Die Lichter geh'n aus, wird es spät, die Erde bebt
Wer holt an der Tanke Spezi und Alizé?
Bin im Sicko Mode wie Drake, frische Bathing Apes, Fabergé (wouh)
Mein Hemd ist aus L.A. und ist von Chrome Hearts (Chrome Hearts)
Melodien in mei'm Kopf, so wie bei Mozart (Chrome Hearts)
Bereis' die Welt und zeige allen unsre Botschaft (Botschaft)

Been knew I was the one (One)
Still got niggas on the run, yeah (On the run, yeah)

I got these diamonds, my chain swang
I got these bands, ain't shit changed
Talkin' like you want that smoke (Smoke)
We want the same thing (Brra)
I got a brand new check (Check)
Then I put ten on my neck, mmm
Then I got a new Patek, yeah
Fly in that bitch with a TEC
Six on a new fit, fifty for a drop-top (Drop)
I was off a bean, the Tech made me Wock' talk (Talk)
Never been a lame, ain't shit to make her top drop
Smokin' on gas, 'Wood how I lift off
Last year was broke, this year flooded a Patek
I keep forty racks in my Seattle attic
I hit her two times, then you niggas can have it (Oh-oh)
My young niggas pull up and shoot like the Magic (Prrt)

[Verse 1]
Thinkin' 'bout my grandmama and shit
I got the number one record, they acknowledged the jit (Ayy, yo, Kid)
They goin' crazy when they play it, head bobbin' and shit
And I'm just somewhere fucked up thinkin' 'bout my father and shit
They found him dead a couple days before I started tour
Same day I flew back to the city from Miami
I was out there with the family
Just lookin' at my daughter
Thinkin' to myself like, ""Damn, my baby look just like my daddy""
Same time I got the news, my shit went number one, that's fucked up
That shit there was confusin', a lil' bit, you know I flew in with the stick
Okay, like let me know what's up before I lose it in this bitch
And everybody tryna talk, I ain't tryna talk, I'm tryna click
I'm tryna send somebody wit' him
Somebody let me know what's happenin'
My last name K-I-R-K, Kirk
You know how I rock behind my daddy
You know I never gave a fuck about the world, just about my family
How the fuck I make it to the top same day I lost the nigga that had me?
How a nigga perform on BET and a year ago couldn't afford a sandwich?
I had to move in with TG when I went broke movin' out to Cali
What you know about smilin' every day for all your fans, actin' like you happy?
I spent a hundred thousand layin' my daddy to rest, but I ain't braggin'
I got some questions, I'm a die about respect if I don't get answers
My mama stood up in that chair, took it like a G when she had cancer
My brother be thinkin' that we don't love him and let him struggle like we ain't family
Like I won't give up all I got to see you happy, nigga
We shocked the world, everybody know what's happenin', nigga
I'm still Lil' Jon Jon, my song, it just went platinum, nigga
We on our own time, let's go move out to Cali, nigga
Put the kids in homeschool, let's go get us a mansion, nigga
Let's raise our kids right, let's watch the shit we teach 'em, nigga
Let's start a business for you so they can't say that you leechin', nigga
How I know I'm the chosen one, 'cause sometimes when I be speakin', nigga
Like on this song, I ain't rappin', I'm preachin', nigga

[Chorus]
If I love you, then I need ya (Let's go)
I fuck with you like Martin fuck with Gina (Uh)
We family like we Venus and Serena (Hey)
Let's go get married like we Thankgod and Kenisha (Okay)
Don't give a fuck about the world, just 'bout my people (Facts)
I don't care what the fuck they told you, we ain't equal (Uh-uh)
Niggas ain't cut from the same cloth, these niggas see-through (Ayy)
And I be too busy doin' me to see what he do, nigga

[Verse 2]
Yeah, verse two, that lil' nigga from the other side (Uh-huh)
And I do it myself, whenever I ride, you know that my brothers ride (Okay)
And I still got a lotta shit on my mind that I can't undecide (Yeah, yeah)
Got me ready to slide, feelin' like Doughboy when his brother died (Boyz n the Hood)
You know how I step, you know how I rep, you know about Baby, nigga (You know about Baby)
You know how I'm comin' back for that cross if you ever play me, nigga (Get back)
You know how I got it up out the mud and turned it to gravy nigga (Huh)
And hit the rap game like crack cocaine in the '80s, nigga

[Interlude]
Fuck you niggas talkin' 'bout, bruh? Like.. (Oh my God, oh)
Look (Oh my God)
Look, man
Look (Oh my God)
Baby on Baby, now that's Baby on Baby
God is great

[Letra de ""No Te Debí Besar""]

[Intro: C. Tangana & Paloma Mami]
Hmm

[Verso 1: C. Tangana, Paloma Mami & Ambos]
El club a punto de cerrar
Empujo gente pa' pasar
Todos mirándote bailar, hmm (Hmm)
Te entro como un matao'r
Preparado para lo peor
Tu cariño es como un mal dolor
Sonaba la canción de terminar
El club estaba a punto de cerrar
Tú bailaba' sola en la mitad
Y el resto mirando
Siempre ha' sido difícil de imitar
No debí dejarme hipnotizar

[Intro]
You make me feel special

[Verse 1: Chaeyoung]
그런 날이 있어
갑자기 혼자인 것만 같은 날
어딜 가도 내 자리가 아닌 것만 같고
고갠 떨궈지는 날

[Pre-Chorus: Tzuyu, Momo]
그럴 때마다 내게
얼마나 내가 소중한지
말해주는 너의 그 한마디에
Everything's alright
초라한 nobody 에서 다시 somebody
특별한 나로 변해

[Chorus: Sana, Nayeon]
You make me feel special
세상이 아무리 날 주저앉혀도 (앉혀도)
아프고 아픈 말들이 날 찔러도
네가 있어 난 다시 웃어
That's what you do
Again, I feel special
아무것도 아닌 존재 같다가도
사라져도 모를 사람 같다가도
날 부르는 네 목소리에
I feel loved, I feel so special

[Verse 2: Mina]
자꾸 숨고만 싶어서
마주 하기가 싫어서
모든 게 의미를 잃은 듯이
내가 의미를 잃은 듯이
가만히 주저앉아 있을 때

[Pre-Chorus: Momo, Tzuyu]
그때 내 앞에 나타난 너의
따뜻한 미소와 손길에
Everything's alright
초라한 nobody 에서 다시 somebody
특별한 나로 변해

[Chorus: Jihyo, Jeongyeon]
You make me feel special
세상이 아무리 날 주저앉혀도
아프고 아픈 말들이 날 찔러도
네가 있어 난 다시 웃어
That's what you do
Again, I feel special
아무것도 아닌 존재 같다가도
사라져도 모를 사람 같다가도
날 부르는 네 목소리에
I feel loved, I feel so special

[Bridge: Dahyun]
Uh, you make everything alright
구름이 쫙 낀 햇살 한 줌 없는 날
네가 바로 나의 shining light
That's what you do
아무리 어두운 밤도 다시 낮
I owe it to you
Because you make me feel

[Chorus: Jihyo, Nayeon]

[Intro]
Heartless (Heartless, heartless)
So heartless (So heartless, so heartless)

[Verse 1]
Say you goin' out late
I count down till you call me
It's just one of those things
That you do when you're lonely
And you're all about the chase
But you won't ever let me catch you
And I wish I was the same
But I know I'm gonna let you
Win again and when I do
It's gonna hurt like Hell
And you don't mean to
That's what I tell myself

[Chorus]
But why you gotta be so heartless?
I know you think it's harmless
You're tearing me apart and
Girl, the hardest part is
You're so high on attention
Taking miles from inches
Leave me in the darkness
Never finish what we started
Girl, why you gotta be so heartless? (So heartless, so heartless)
Why you gotta be so heartless? (So heartless, so heartless)

[Verse 2]
Monday night was definitely not our night
Tuesday night was just another fight
Wednesday, I thought everything would change
Thursday came and it was still the same
Friday night, we went out on the town
Saturday, we should have burned it down
Sunday morning came and now you're gone
I should prolly know this shit by now
Ah, oh
I should prolly know this shit by now
But no, no

[Chorus]
Why you gotta be so heartless?
I know you think it's harmless
You're tearing me apart and
Girl, the hardest part is

Girl, why you gotta be so in between
Loving me and leaving, leaving?
Ah, oh (Ah, oh)
I should prolly know this shit by now
But no, no (But no)

[Chorus]
Why you gotta be so heartless?
I know you think it's harmless
You're tearing me apart and
Girl, the hardest part is
You're so high on attention
Taking miles from inches
Leave me in the darkness
Never finish what we started
Girl, why you gotta be so heartless?  (Heartless, heartless)
Why you gotta be so heartless? (So heartless, so heartless)
Girl, why you gotta be so heartless?  (Heartless, heartless)
Why you gotta be so heartless? (So heartless, so heartless)

[Intro]
Heartless (Heartless, heartless)
So heartless (So heartless, so heartless)

[Verse 1]
Say you goin' out late
I count down till you call me
It's just one of those things
That you do when you're lonely
And you're all about the chase
But you won't ever let me catch you
And I wish I was the same
But I know I'm gonna let you
Win again and when I do
It's gonna hurt like Hell
And you don't mean to
That's what I tell myself

[Chorus]
But why you gotta be so heartless?
I know you think it's harmless
You're tearing me apart and
Girl, the hardest part is
You're so high on attention
Taking miles from inches
Leave me in the darkness
Never finish what we started
Girl, why you gotta be so heartless? (So heartless, so heartless)
Why you gotta be so heartless? (So heartless, so heartless)

[Verse 2]
Monday night was definitely not our night
Tuesday night was just another fight
Wednesday, I thought everything would change
Thursday came and it was still the same
Friday night, we went out on the town
Saturday, we should have burned it down
Sunday morning came and now you're gone
I should prolly know this shit by now
Ah, oh
I should prolly know this shit by now
But no, no

[Chorus]
Why you gotta be so heartless?
I know you think it's harmless
You're tearing me apart and
Girl, the hardest part is
You're so high on attention
Taking miles from inches
Leave me in the darkness
Never finish what we started
Girl, why you gotta be so heartless? (So heartless, so heartless)
Why you gotta be so heartless? (So heartless, so heartless)

[Bridge]
Girl, why you gotta be so in between
Loving me and leaving, leaving?
Ah, oh (Ah, oh)

When the hand you wanna hold is a weapon and

Yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh, eh (Suénalo)
Me dijeron que te acabas de dejar (Eh)
Que el bobo aquel te engañó
Que ya no crees en el amor (No)
Que andas suelta igual que yo (Bad Bunny)
No sé, pero la noche está pa’ desquitarno' (Hey, hey)
Otro shot vamo' a darno’ (Mujeres, get ready, sube)
Que yo también quiero joder, vacilar (¿Qué, qué, qué?)
Trae a to'a tus amiga', que yo las voy a poner a fumar
Dale hasta abajo, pata' abajo sin parar, yeh

[Coro: Lunay, Bad Bunny & Daddy Yankee]
Porque 'tar soltera está de moda
Por eso ella no se enamora (Rra, rra)
'Tar soltera está de moda
Por eso no va a cambiar (Ella no va a cambiar)
Estar soltera está de moda (¿Qué, qué, qué?)
Por eso ella no se enamora (Dile; ¡no!)
Estar soltera está de moda (D-D-D-D-D-D.Y.)
Por eso no va a cambiar (¡Da-ddy Yan-kee!)

[Post-Coro: Daddy Yankee]
Ella 'tá soltera (Wuh, wuh), con su' amiga’ revuelta’
Va pa' la disco y a nadie le rinde cuenta’ (Prr)
'Tá soltera (Fuego), con su' amiga' revuelta’
Va pa' la disco y a nadie le rinde cuenta' (Fue', fue'. fue')

[Verso 1: Daddy Yankee]
Ella vacila y vive en la joda
No 'tá lista pa' un trajecito blanco en la boda
Puede perrear con uno, como sea, lo baila sola (Chi-chi-chi)
Batea pa' .500, siempre bota la bola (¿Cómo?)
Pon-, pónme a prueba, a ver, que to' el peso te va a caer
La orden de cateo, las mano' contra la pare'
Pa' darle pa'l piso no pide permiso (No, wuh!)
Si está soltera, sin compromiso (¿Qué, qué?)
'Tá pa' la rumba y hacer dinero y yo que soy un bandolero
Me gustan como tú, las que no creen en sentimiento' ni un 14 de febrero (D-D-D.Y)

[Pre-Coro: Lunay]
Ella lo que quiere e' joder, vacilar
Solita pa' romper la disco
Ella lo que quiere e' joder, vacilar (Chi-chi-chi)
Dale hasta abajo, pata' abajo sin parar

Y estar soltera está de moda
Por eso ella no se enamora (¡Ble!)
Estar soltera está de moda (Yeh)
Por eso no va a cambiar (Ella no va a cambiar)
Y estar soltera está de moda
Por eso ella no se enamora (Blu, blu)
'Ta-'tar soltera está de moda (Sube, sube)
Por eso no va a cambiar

[Verso 2: Bad Bunny & Daddy Yankee]
Yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh
Se cansó de lo' embuste' y a su vida le hizo un ajuste, ey (Prr)
Si la ves en la disco con las de ella', no te asuste' (¡No!)
Puesta pa'l problema, así que no la busque'
Y déjala volar como decía Tito (Hu-huh)
A ese culo el traje le queda chiquito (Ah)
La leona no está puesta pa' gatito' (No), ey
Y sin ti, le va bonito
Hoy se siente coqueta (¿Qué, qué?)
Siempre activa, nunca quieta
To'a las moña' son violeta'
El corazón lo tiene a dieta, ey
Pa' que ningún cabrón se meta (Sube, sube, sube, sube)
Te dejó en read otra ve'
Te ha picha'o to' las llamada' y to' lo' text
¿Tú no entiende' que hace rato dijo ""Next""?
La nena está haciendo más ticket que el ex, eh (¡Chin'-ching!)

[Verso 3: Lunay & Daddy Yankee]
Ponte-ponte pa' la vuelta, que yo voy pa'l party (Lunay, dile)
Si no, nos vemo', mami, en el after party
Ponte pa'l problema, ándale, déjate ver
Lo que aquí empezamo', lo matamo' en el motel (Fuego)
Tú estás suelta por ahí, yo estoy suelto por acá
Hacerte wiki-wiki, como dice Yaviah
Soltó el corazón, sacó a pasear la maldá'
(Tiene la mente dañá')

[Pre-Coro: Bad Bunny, Daddy Yankee & Ambos]
(Yeh, yeh)
Ella lo que quiere e' joder, vacilar (Vacilar ¡Wuh!)
Solita pa' romper la disco
Ella lo que quiere e' joder, vacilar (Wi-wi)
Dale hasta abajo, pata' abajo sin parar (Brr)

[Coro: Bad Bunny, Lunay & Daddy Yankee]
Que estar soltera está de moda
Hace lo que quiera y que se joda
Estar soltera está de moda
Ella no le va a bajar (Ella no va a cambiar)
Estar soltera está de moda
Por eso ella no se enamora (Rra-rra)
'Tar soltera está de moda (Sí)
Por eso no va a cam-cam-cambiar (Fue')

[Post-Coro: Daddy Yankee]
Ella 'tá soltera (Wuh-wuh), con su' amiga' revuelta' (D-D-D)
Revuelta', revuelta', revuelta' (Rrr)
Ella 'tá soltera (¡Fuego!), con su' amiga' revu'

Va pa' la disco y a nadie le rinde cuenta' (Fue', fue'. fue')

[Verso 1: Daddy Yankee]
Ella vacila y vive en la joda
No 'tá lista pa' un trajecito blanco en la boda
Puede perrear con uno, como sea, lo baila sola (Chi-chi-chi)
Batea pa' .500, siempre bota la bola (¿Cómo?)
Pon-, pónme a prueba, a ver, que to' el peso te va a caer
La orden de cateo, las mano' contra la pare'
Pa' darle pa'l piso no pide permiso (No, wuh!)
Si está soltera, sin compromiso (¿Qué, qué?)
'Tá pa' la rumba y hacer dinero y yo que soy un bandolero
Me gustan como tú, las que no creen en sentimiento' ni un 14 de febrero (D-D-D.Y)

[Pre-Coro: Lunay]
Ella lo que quiere e' joder, vacilar
Solita pa' romper la disco
Ella lo que quiere e' joder, vacilar (Chi-chi-chi)
Dale hasta abajo, pata' abajo sin parar

[Coro: Lunay & Daddy Yankee]
Y estar soltera está de moda
Por eso ella no se enamora (¡Ble!)
Estar soltera está de moda (Yeh)
Por eso no va a cambiar (Ella no va a cambiar)
Y estar soltera está de moda
Por eso ella no se enamora (Blu, blu)
'Ta-'tar soltera está de moda (Sube, sube)
Por eso no va a cambiar

[Verso 2: Bad Bunny & Daddy Yankee]
Yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh
Se cansó de lo' embuste' y a su vida le hizo un ajuste, ey (Prr)
Si la ves en la disco con las de ella', no te asuste' (¡No!)
Puesta pa'l problema, así que no la busque'
Y déjala volar como decía Tito (Hu-huh)
A ese culo el traje le queda chiquito (Ah)
La leona no está puesta pa' gatito' (No), ey
Y sin ti, le va bonito
Hoy se siente coqueta (¿Qué, qué?)
Siempre activa, nunca quieta
To'a las moña' son violeta'
El corazón lo tiene a dieta, ey
Pa' que ningún cabrón se meta (Sube, sube, sube, sube)
Te dejó en read otra ve'
Te ha picha'o to' las llamada' y to' lo' text
¿Tú no entiende' que hace rato dijo ""Next""?
La nena está haciendo más ticket que el ex, eh (¡Chin'-ching!)

[Verso 3: Lunay & Daddy Yankee]
Ponte-ponte pa' la vuelta, que yo voy pa'l party (Lunay, dile)
Si no, nos vemo', mami, en el after party
Ponte pa'l problema, ándale, déjate ver
Lo que aquí empezamo', lo matamo' en el motel (Fuego)
Tú estás suelta por ahí, yo estoy suelto por acá
Hacerte wiki-wiki, como dice Yaviah
Soltó el corazón, sacó a pasear la maldá'
(Tiene la mente dañá')

[Pre-Coro: Bad Bunny, Daddy Yankee & Ambos]
(Yeh, yeh)
Ella lo que quiere e' joder, vacilar (Vacilar ¡Wuh!)
Solita pa' romper la disco
Ella lo que quiere e' joder, vacilar (Wi-wi)
Dale hasta abajo, pata' abajo sin parar (Brr)

[Coro: Bad Bunny, Lunay & Daddy Yankee]
Que estar soltera está de moda
Hace lo que quiera y que se joda
Estar soltera está de moda
Ella no le va a bajar (Ella no va a cambiar)
Estar soltera está de moda
Por eso ella no se enamora (Rra-rra)
'Tar soltera está de moda (Sí)
Por eso no va a cam-cam-cambiar (Fue')

[Post-Coro: Daddy Yankee]
Ella 'tá soltera (Wuh-wuh), con su' amiga' revuelta' (D-D-D)
Revuelta', revuelta', revuelta' (Rrr)
Ella 'tá soltera (¡Fuego!), con su' amiga' revu'
Va pa' la disco y a nadie le rinde cuenta (¡Fue'!)

Huh, huh, huh

[Chorus]
I ain't gon' say too much when a nigga speakin' on that hot shit
Fuck the police, 'cause them bitches ain't gon' stop shit
Oppositions mad, if they play they gettin' popped quick
Flyest nigga in the game, yeah, I'm a cockpit
Posted on Camelot, wit' a hunnid some' shottas
I be swimmin' wit' the sharks, lil' nigga, you a lobster
Bullets heat a nigga up, like he eatin' on some pasta
And shoutout to Kingston, I keep me some Rastas

[Verse 1]
My niggas trappin' out the bando, shoutout to the Migos
If a nigga knock wrong, shoot him through the peephole
The trap always open, bitch, we ain't never closed
We movin' them packs and we movin' them kilos
Step one, step two, do my dance in this bitch
Got a hunnid some' drums like a band in this bitch
Mane she keep on bitchin', all that naggin' and shit
Hoe shut the fuck up and jus' gag on this dick
I'm a side nigga, and I love when she swallow
If a nigga say something, hit him wit' a hollow
That glizzy, knock ya meat out ya taco
Flexin' on these bitches, they call me Johnny Bravo
School of hard knocks, let me take you to class
My bitch is real skinny but she got a lot of ass
I love counting money, I get a lot of cash
If you try to take it from me, his toe gon' have a tag

All up in the party, you know we keep them carbons
Bring a nigga chills like I work at Baskin-Robbins
I love Batman, but a young nigga robbin'
Firework show, 'cause my niggas get to sparklin'
I'm a hothead, I'll crash any second
He speakin' on who? Send his bitch ass to heaven
Extended clips, when we tote them MAC-11's
My niggas they be crippin', they be screamin' out them 7's
Why you investigating me? 'Cause I don't know a thing
And I'ma always keep a solid, I ain't never sang
You know I'm Shotta Fam, always gotta rep the gang
He kept on dissin' so a nigga had to snatch his brain

[Intro: J Balvin & El Alfa]
(Major Lazer; J Balvin, man
Latino gang; wuh; global; El Alfa; yao'
Wuh; qué ca'; ¡yesca!; leggo')

[Coro: J Balvin & El Alfa]
Qué calor (Qué ca'), qué ca' (Qué ca')
En la discoteca qué calor (Qué ca')
Yesca (Qué ca'), para la' muñeca', por favor
Qué ca' (Qué ca'), en la discoteca qué calor (Qué ca')
Yesca (Qué ca'), para la' muñeca', por favor

[Verso 1: J Balvin]
Esa rubia no me entiende si yo le hablo en español (What?)
Pero se aprendió la canción a la perfección (Lo sabe)
Por mi patria, por mi nación, ninguna discriminación
Aquí no hay raza ni religión, báilalo por obligación

[Interludio: J Balvin & El Alfa]
Qué calor
(Qué ca', qué ca', qué ca', qué ca'
Qué ca', qué ca', qué ca', qué ca')
Qué calor
(Qué ca'-qué ca', qué ca')
Qué calor, qué ca' en la discoteca
Qué calor, yesca para las muñeca'
(Por favor; por favor; wah, wah)

[Verso 2: El Alfa]
La' mujere' me la' como al vapor
En la playa bañado en sudor
Lo' bikini' te quedan mejor
Tú ere' mi amor, -mor, -mor, -mor
Cada ve' que veo ese booty yo me quedo loco
Tú le da' hasta abajo, mami, con mucho saoco

[Puente: El Alfa]
Como tú lo mueve' en el mundo lo mueven poco'
Dale, dale, baila a lo loco
Como tú lo mueve' en el mundo lo mueven poco'
Dale, dale, baila a lo loco
Como tú lo mueve' en el mundo lo mueven poco'

[Refrán: J Balvin]
Calentamiento global (¡Wuh!)
Anda suelto el animal (Grr)
Mano arriba el que e' real (Hah)
(Esto se va a hacer viral)

[Coro: J Balvin]

[Verso 1: J Balvin]
Esa rubia no me entiende si yo le hablo en español (What?)
Pero se aprendió la canción a la perfección (Lo sabe)
Por mi patria, por mi nación, ninguna discriminación
Aquí no hay raza ni religión, báilalo por obligación

La' mujere' me la' como al vapor
En la playa bañado en sudor
Lo' bikini' te quedan mejor
Tú ere' mi amor, -mor, -mor, -mor
Cada ve' que veo ese booty yo me quedo loco
Tú le da' hasta abajo, mami, con mucho saoco

[Puente: El Alfa]
Como tú lo mueve' en el mundo lo mueven poco'

Ayy, Panini, don't you be a meanie
Thought you wanted me to go up
Why you tryna keep me teeny? I
It's a dream, he wished it on a genie
I got fans finally, ain't you wantin' them to see me? I

[Refrain: Lil Nas X]
I thought you want this for my life, for my life
Said you wanted to see me thrive, you lied

[Chorus: Lil Nas X & DaBaby]
Just say to me what you want from me
Just say to me what you want from me
Baby, let's go, uh

[Verse 2: DaBaby]
Okay, this song right here remind me of my ex
Say I be declinin' all her calls and I don't respond to none of her texts
I be like, ""Girl, hush your mouth, you know I ain't got time for nothin' but sex""
She know I injured my right hand so when I get behind I use my left
She watched that ""Walker Texas Ranger,"" say I remind her of Nas X
I'm talkin' ""Old Town Road,"" all my hoes down low
They like girls and I like girls, three at a time, sometimes four
And if my backend not all hundreds and ain't on time, then I don't go
I be like...

[Chorus: Lil Nas X & DaBaby]
Say to me what you want from me
Just say to me what you want from me
What you want?

[Verse 3: Lil Nas X]
Ayy, Panini, don't you be a meanie
Thought you wanted me to go up
Why you tryna keep me teeny now?
Now they need me, number one on streaming
Oh yeah, you used to love me
So what happened, what's the meaning? I

[Refrain: Lil Nas X]
I thought you want this for my life, for my life
Said you wanted to see me thrive, you lied

[Bridge: Lil Nas X]
Now when it's all done, I get the upper hand
I need a big Benz, not another fan
But I still want you as a fan
I'ma need to sit down, don't mean to make demands
But I need you to...

Wo warst du gestern Nacht schon wieder ohne mich?
Du hast mir doch versprochen, du lässt mich niemals im Stich
Was hast du dir gedacht? Ich brech' dir dein Genick
Bitte komm mal klar und lass mal deine Tricks
Wo warst du gestern Nacht schon wieder ohne mich?
Du hast mir doch versprochen, du lässt mich niemals im Stich
Was hast du dir gedacht? Ich brech' dir dein Genick
Bitte komm mal klar und lass mal deine Tricks

[Part 1]
Ja, du meintest, du bist anders als die andern
Ich dachte, es gibt immer nur uns beide
Aber was machst du da wieder für 'ne Scheiße?
Ja, ich zähl' jetzt mein Cash ganz allein hier im Bett
Du gehst saufen und verlierst schon wieder im Roulette
Du rufst an, sagst: „Hey Lori, brauch' 'n bisschen Geld“
Aber nein, für dich gibt es hier kein Cent

[Pre-Hook]
Nichts ist für immer, der Schmerz vergeht
Rauch' noch 'ne Kippe und leb' mein Leben
Und du chillst allein im Regen

Bin jetzt meine eigene Bank

Hoy  está soltera, y quiere roce
Pide  que la toque (Yah), toque (Yah), toque (Yah; toque)

[Coro: Justin Quiles & Zion]
O-O-O-Ojalá que nunca pare el DJ de sonar
Pa'  que siga el baile (Baile)
Él dice que termina a las tre'
Pero yo le pagué pa' que siga a las die' (A las die')
Ojalá y que nunca pare el DJ de sonar
Pa'  que siga el baile (Baile)
Él dice que termina a las tre'
Pero yo le pagué pa' que siga a las die'

[Verso 1: Farruko]
Di-Di-Di (Pri-yah-yah)
Dile al DJ que me ponga la de ""Otro Trago"" (¡Farru!)
O la que canta Sech y que se quede, que yo le pago (Yah-yah)
Y ahora a lo oscuro y sin disimulo (Tra)
Olvidando las pena' me la perreé (¡Pu-pu-pu-pum!)
Y que esto siga hasta las 6 de la madrugada
¿Dónde están las solteras y los que fuman marihuana?
Y aunque de aquí me boten no me voy hasta mañana (Jajajaja)
Y si no' vamo' e' pa' un hotel todo el fin de semana (¡Farru!)

[Verso 2: Dalex]
Sigue y no pare'
Se te sube el traje y el booty se te sale
3 de la mañana, tú y yo somo' iguale'
Tratan de imitarte, pero no, no les sale
No, no les sale (No les sale)
Oah, ¿Dónde están las nena' que se van a to'a? (To'a)
Las que bellaquean, las que colaboran (Colaboran)
Las que lo twerkean como a 100 por hora
Y sin mirar la hora, yeih

[Coro: Justin Quiles & Zion]
Ojalá que nunca pare el DJ de sonar
Pa' que siga el baile (Baile)
Él dice que termina a las tre'
Pero yo le pagué pa' que siga a las die' (A las die')
Ojalá y que nunca pare el DJ de sonar
Pa' que siga el baile (Baile)

Pero yo le pagué pa' que siga a las die'

[Verso 3: Natti Natasha]
(Natti Na')
Que se reporten todas las mujeres soltera'
Que sin freno van a janguear
Salí matando con la combi', taco' y cartera
Si se te olvido, soy la criminal (Yah)
Ponte, dale ponte, nene, que mi jumper a ti te tiene mal
Ponte, dale ponte, que este booty rompe, no vaya a lucir mal

[Verso 4: Zion]
So, dale, póntele detrás y agárrale el pantalón
Que a ese booty está noche yo no le voy a dar perdó-ón
Así que (Así que), póntele tuyo, dale, aprieta nena (Aprieta nena)
En la disco hay mucha', pero solo tú me llenas
Y yo sé que esto es puro vaciló-ón
You know

[Coro: Justin Quiles & Zion]
O-O-O-Ojalá que nunca pare el DJ de sonar
Pa' que siga el baile (Baile)

Estacionen sus vehículo' (Vehículo')
Que el party no acaba, te lo digo yo (Digo yo)
Vamos, DJ, repítelo
Una sí, una no, una sí, una no (Una no)
Dale, mami, muévelo (Muévelo)
Hazte dueña del terreno (Terreno, terreno)
Que ahorita me adueño yo
Y te sueno como viernes de estreno (Estreno)

You helped me fight when I was giving in
And you made me laugh when I was losing it

[Letra de ""Desconocidos"" ft. Manuel Turizo & Camilo]

[Intro: Mau y Ricky, Manuel Turizo]
Desconocidos
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Sí, sí

[Pre-Coro: Mau y Ricky, Manuel Turizo]
Apenas somos dos desconocidos
Con ganas de besarse
Con ganas de que pase lo que pase
Apenas somos dos (Apenas somos dos)
Desconocidos
Con miedo a enamorarse
Con miedo de que pase lo que pase

[Coro: Mau y Ricky, Manuel Turizo]
Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Si quieres, después nos enamoramos
Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Paso a paso, que la cagamos
Vamo' a pasar un buen rato (Sí)
Si quieres, después nos enamoramos
Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Paso a paso, que la cagamos

[Verso 1: Camilo]
Oye, oye, óyeme bien
Tú eres lo que busco yo en una mujer
Te tengo en la mira desde que llegué
Siento que eres mía, yo no sé por qué
Ay, yo sé que es mentira
Decir que soy el hombre de tu vida
Si tú ayer no me conocías
Y no sabías que me querías

[Coro: Camilo, Mau y Ricky]
Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Y si quieres, después nos enamoramos
Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Paso a paso, que la cagamos
Vamo' a pasar un buen rato (Un rato)
Si quieres, después nos enamoramos (Después nos enamoramos)
Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Paso a paso, que la cagamos
Y lo bailamo' lentico

[Verso 2: Manuel Turizo]
No sé como explicar lo que en ti estoy viendo
Me encanta como estás moviéndote
Tu cuerpo estrella contra mi cuerpo, ma
No lo entiendo
Dime si de mí te estabas escondiendo
Tú tan bella y yo apenas conociéndote
Bailemos sin importar quién esté viendo
Hoy yo te quiero tener conmigo, conmigo
Yo quiero pasarla bien contigo, contigo
Hoy yo te quiero tener conmigo, conmigo
Y ver el amanecer contigo, contigo

[Pre-Coro: Mau y Ricky, Camilo, Mau y Ricky & Manuel Turizo]
Apenas somos dos desconocidos
Con ganas de besarse (Don miedo a enamorarse)
Con ganas de que pase lo que pase
Apenas somos dos
Desconocidos (Dos desconocidos)
Con miedo a enamorarse (Con ganas de besarse)
Con miedo de que pase lo que pase

[Coro: Mau y Ricky, Manuel Turizo & Camilo]
Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Si quieres, después nos enamoramos (Uoh)
Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Paso a paso, que la cagamos
Ay, vamo' a pasar un buen rato (Sí)
Y si quieres, después nos enamoramos
Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Paso a paso, que la cagamos

[Letra de ""Desconocidos"" ft. Manuel Turizo & Camilo]

[Intro: Mau y Ricky, Manuel Turizo]
Desconocidos
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Sí, sí

[Pre-Coro: Mau y Ricky, Manuel Turizo]
Apenas somos dos desconocidos
Con ganas de besarse
Con ganas de que pase lo que pase
Apenas somos dos (Apenas somos dos)
Desconocidos
Con miedo a enamorarse
Con miedo de que pase lo que pase

[Coro: Mau y Ricky, Manuel Turizo]
Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Si quieres, después nos enamoramos
Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Paso a paso, que la cagamos
Vamo' a pasar un buen rato (Sí)
Si quieres, después nos enamoramos
Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Paso a paso, que la cagamos

[Verso 1: Camilo]
Oye, oye, óyeme bien
Tú eres lo que busco yo en una mujer
Te tengo en la mira desde que llegué
Siento que eres mía, yo no sé por qué
Ay, yo sé que es mentira
Decir que soy el hombre de tu vida
Si tú ayer no me conocías
Y no sabías que me querías

[Coro: Camilo, Mau y Ricky]
Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Y si quieres, después nos enamoramos
Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Paso a paso, que la cagamos
Vamo' a pasar un buen rato (Un rato)
Si quieres, después nos enamoramos (Después nos enamoramos)
Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Paso a paso, que la cagamos
Y lo bailamo' lentico

[Verso 2: Manuel Turizo]
No sé como explicar lo que en ti estoy viendo
Me encanta como estás moviéndote
Tu cuerpo estrella contra mi cuerpo, ma
No lo entiendo
Dime si de mí te estabas escondiendo
Tú tan bella y yo apenas conociéndote
Bailemos sin importar quién esté viendo
Hoy yo te quiero tener conmigo, conmigo
Yo quiero pasarla bien contigo, contigo
Hoy yo te quiero tener conmigo, conmigo
Y ver el amanecer contigo, contigo

[Pre-Coro: Mau y Ricky, Camilo, Mau y Ricky & Manuel Turizo]
Apenas somos dos desconocidos
Con ganas de besarse (Don miedo a enamorarse)
Con ganas de que pase lo que pase
Apenas somos dos
Desconocidos (Dos desconocidos)
Con miedo a enamorarse (Con ganas de besarse)
Con miedo de que pase lo que pase

[Coro: Mau y Ricky, Manuel Turizo & Camilo]
Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Si quieres, después nos enamoramos (Uoh)
Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Paso a paso, que la cagamos
Ay, vamo' a pasar un buen rato (Sí)
Y si quieres, después nos enamoramos
Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Paso a paso, que la cagamos

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh,  oh, oh
Oh,  oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
We couldn't turn around 'til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now, but know I ain't too proud
I  couldn't be there even when I tried
You  don't believe it, we do this every time

[Chorus]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed  the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm  waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

[Verse 2]
Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex though, the sex though
And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go

[Chorus]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

[Bridge]
Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
It's only me, what you got to lose?
Make up your mind, tell me, what are you gonna do?
It's only me, let it go

[Chorus]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

You fucked me so good that I almost said ""I love you""
You're fun and you’re wild
But you don't know the half of the shit that you put me through

But I can’t change that, and I can't change your mood, ah

And dance to the rhythm, it gets harder

I love her so bad, but she treats me like shit
On lockdown, like a penitentiary
She spreads her lovin' all over

Oh-oh-oh, woah, woah
It's fire

[Chorus]
Huh, as we go on, we remember
All the times we spent together (Ooh, woah)
As our lives change (Ooh, woah), from whatever
We will still be (We will still), friends forever

[Verse 1]
First off, tell the girl in my math class I'm rich
And you broke, bitch, I had the last laugh
And to the dumb nigga in my science lab
How'd it feel when we fought and you caught a jab?
Man, fuck prom, fuck the teacher that was always talkin' on the intercom
And fuck the student that we thought was always gon' bring in a bomb
And all of the girls wild, them bitches was too foul
They all on my dick now

[Chorus]
Huh, as we go on (As we go on), we remember (We remember)
All the times we (All the times), spent together (Ooh, woah)
As our lives change (Ooh, woah), from whatever
We will still be (We will still), friends forever

[Verse 2]
Um, information leaker, had a crush on one of my teachers
Used to fantasize makin' love with her behind the bleachers
And to all the people who ain't like me, I ain't like me either
Half my class was havin' kids, guess we had that jungle fever
Uh, I was waitin' for my graduation (Uh-huh), growin' impatient (Uh-huh)
What I didn't know was this grown-up world (This grown-up world)
Was just school in a blown-up world (This blown-up world)
There's still gossip, there's still drama, there's still problems
There's a right and there's a wrong
There's still people that I think won't love me 'til I'm gone
Low-key miss the days walkin' 'round in my school halls
But now I got a bigger job, the world screamin' my songs

[Chorus]
Huh, as we go on (As we go on), we remember (We remember)
All the times we (All the times), spent together (We were close)
As our lives change (As we change), from whatever (From what we know)
We will still be (We will still), friends forever (Enemies 'til the end)


[Outro]
Lauren is such a bitch (I know, right?)
I don't even understand why guys like her, she's not even cute
She's not even pretty
Have you seen how much makeup she wears?
And by the way she Facetunes her pictures so much (Oh my God, you are so right)
I honestly think she bought her followers
She barely gets any likes any way (Um, she's honestly kinda sad)
And you wanna know the craziest part about all of it? (What?)
She doesn't even have any idea her boyfriend's been cheatin' on her this entire time (Huh?)

[Verse 1]
Cinnamon in my teeth
From your kiss, you're touching me
All the pills that you take
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me at arm's length don't work
You try to push me out, but I just find my way back in
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me out, I win

[Chorus]
There's things I wanna say to you, but I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about, but better not to give
But if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did

[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

[Verse 1]
You took my sadness out of context
At the Mariners Apartment Complex
I ain't no candle in the wind
I'm the board, the lightning, the thunder
Kind of girl who's gonna make you wonder
Who you are and who you've been

[Pre-Chorus]
And who I've been is with you on these beaches
Your Venice bitch, your die-hard, your weakness
Maybe I could save you from your sins
So kiss the sky and whisper to Jesus
My, my, my, you found this, you need this
Take a deep breath, baby, let me in

You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am
I'm your man
I'm your man

[Verse 2]
They mistook my kindness for weakness
I fucked up, I know that, but Jesus
Can't a girl just do the best she can?
Catch a wave and take in the sweetness
Think about it, the darkness, the deepness
All the things that make me who I am

[Pre-Chorus]
And who I am is a big-time believer
That people can change, but you don't have to leave her
When everyone's talking, you can make a stand
'Cause even in the dark, I feel your resistance
You can see my heart burning in the distance
Baby, baby, baby, I'm your man (Yeah)

Couple riders with them llamas if you pick a bone wit’ me
Put my bitch up on designer, got Balenci' on her feet
My Mama say a couple prayers, keep them demons off me
'Cause I know I’m out here blessed, got so many reasons on me
Yeah, niggas done tried and niggas done died, too many believers around me
Yeah, I know my enemies meeting up, double-teaming on me
Now you know nobody tried that ever got pieces off me
Fucking these hoes 'til they be dying, don't catch a seizure on me
See, Ferg used to move the product in the old school (Yeah)
Thumbing through paper from last year but it's not old news (Right)
My psycho bitch, she got me shopping up at Whole Foods
Fucking these cougars like a young nigga s'posed to
I got your bitch up on the mattress while I'm flying OT (Woo!)
I'm sick and tired of all the yapping, little nigga I'm your OG (Woo!)
My diamonds shining like the ball that drop on New Year’s Eve (Come on!)
And she countdown to the D, she be like ""5-4-3""

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg & Big Sean]
Now drop down, you a freak (Milly rock)
Bend it over, touch your feet (Yeah!)
Shake that booty, I know it’s little but unique (So unique)
Back that thing up on my nigga from the D (Woah, oh, that's me?)

[Verse 2: Big Sean & A$AP Ferg]
Okay, back out the hearse, they trapped out the church (Woo!)
Niggas say my name, okay they asked for the worst (Come on!)
Me and A$AP Ferg preaching back to back on the verse (Damn!)
Hit-Boy on the beat so, bitch, you gotta go berserk (That’s right!)
Kill 'em off one-by-one, ""Final Destination""
Fuck that medication, I'm sipping cold flu Echinacea (Come on!)
You done fucked up, I stayed up, sleep deprivation  (Woo!)
They on the search nigga (Uh!), know your worth nigga (Yeah!)
Tell the DJ bring it back, reimburse niggas (Damn)
Alhamdulillāh, my finance advisors been through hell
Oh well, pshh, we on fire (Woo, woo!)
Brung her back home more times than McGwire, higher (Grr)
Trap Lord packed out the risers
Big getting his bread, your pocket on carb diets
I just start up a riot at all the Hyatts
And make them hoes leave right before they cook the omelets (Woo, woo!)

Drop down (Woah), you a freak (Woah)
Bend it over (Yeah), touch your feet (Touch your feet)
Shake that booty, I know it's little but unique (So unique)

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
You stuck in the friend zone, I tell that four-five the fifth, ayy
Hunnid bands inside my shorts, DeChino the shit, ayy
Try to stuff it all in, but it don't even fit, ayy
Know that I been with the shits ever since a jit, ayy
I made my first million, I'm like, ""Shit, this is it,"" ayy
30 for a walkthrough, man, we had that bitch lit, ayy
Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip
Out the window of the Benzo, we get seen in the rent'
And I'm like ""Whoa, man, my neck so goddamn cold”
Diamonds wet, my t-shirt soaked
I got homies, let it go, oh
My money thick, won't ever fold
She said, ""Can I have some to hold?""
And I can't ever tell you no

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
The AP goin' psycho, my Rollie goin' brazy
I'm hittin' lil' mama, she wanna have my babies
It's fifty on the pinky, chain so stanky
You should see the whip, promise I can take yo' bitch
Dolla ridin' in an old school Chevy, it's a drop top
Boolin' with a thot-thot, she gon' give me top-top
Just one switch, I can make the ass drop (Hey)
Ayy, take you to the smoke shop
We gon' get high, ayy, we gon' hit Rodeo
Dial up Valentino, we gon' hit Pico
Take you where I'm from, take you to the slums
This ain't happen overnight, no, these diamonds real bright
Saint Laurent jeans, still in my Vans though
All VVS', put you in a necklace
Girl, you look beautiful tonight
Stars on the roof, they matching with the jewelry

[Intro]
(Fuck niggas, I don't trust niggas
If  you bust triggers and you tell, you a fuck nigga)
If  you tell, you a fuck nigga
(How you tell on the gang? If you mention my name
Boy, I promise I'ma kill you, better duck, nigga
What’s  up with you? I grew up with you
Used  to fuck with you, now I'm wishing that a bus hit you
I used to fuck with you, now I'm wishing that a bus hit you)
(Fuck  niggas, I don't trust niggas
If you bust triggers and you tell, you a fuck nigga)
Fuck nigga
Nah, Lil Tjay (Fuck nigga), yeah, yeah
(Now  I'm wishing that a bus hit you)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Skrrt, skrrt, yeah)

[Refrain]
Grrr, pow, I'ma skip town, see my wrist drown
Everybody wanna fuck with me for benefits now
Man, I wish my nigga Smelly could've seen me lit now
Sit down, maybe roll up, blow a spliff down
Time go by, niggas change so much
Why the fuck these niggas looking at my chain so much?
They just mad 'cause I departed from the game so much
One false move and the gang gon' bust

[Verse 1]
Cartier glasses, 20/20, got a clear view
You a man, I don't fear you
Act up, we gon' mask up, boy, I dare you
Brody catch a body, I'ma leave you in the rearview
Could have did it to me, lil' nigga, you were scared to
You a bluff and you not who you appear to
You'd be starstruck if you see a nigga near you
And your bitch wanna fuck, I don't care to
Careful, if I say links, plan's canceled
I can have your shorty in my bed doing dance moves
Fuck that, let's get right back to the real shit
In the field shit, niggas really used to drill shit
Mama stressed out, whole lot she gotta deal with
Swear every real nigga gon' feel this
Smokin' on drugs 'cause there's too much to deal with
SB strapped up in the field with it

[Chorus]
Fuck niggas, I don't trust niggas
If you bust triggers and you tell, you a fuck nigga
How you tell on the gang? If you mention my name
Boy, I promise I'ma kill you, better duck, nigga
What's up with you? I grew up with you
Used to fuck with you, now I'm wishing that a bus hit you
I used to fuck with you, now I'm wishing that a bus hit you
Fuck niggas, I don't trust niggas
If you bust triggers and you tell, you a fuck nigga
How you tell on the gang? If you mention my name
Boy, I promise I'ma kill you, better duck, nigga
What's up with you? I grew up with you
Used to fuck with you, now I'm wishing that a bus hit you
I used to fuck with you, now I'm wishing that a bus hit you

[Verse 2]
My mama know about the pain, thought I'd never change
But looking back, for the fame, I felt the same
I was stuck up in the streets, but I had a brain
I ain't have no money, we was looking for a nigga chain
And shit, all I ever wanted was to have a name
Had a lot of shit to lose, not enough to gain
And that fuck nigga changed, went against the grain
Found out my homie went fed, almost went insane
Strictly business, you ain't with it, you get parked, nigga
I don't know you, you wasn't with me from the start, nigga
I remember catching stains in the park, nigga
Me and Bubba tryna catch an opp after dark, nigga
My mama told me, ""Wisen up, be a smart nigga""
So all my niggas on go like a kart, nigga
Smelly drive mean a bullet to your heart, nigga
I don't really wanna speak facts, see the chart, nigga

[Refrain]
Grrr, pow, I'ma skip town, see my wrist drown
Everybody wanna fuck with me for benefits now
Man, I wish my nigga Smelly could've seen me lit now
Sit down, maybe roll up, blow a spliff down
Time go by, niggas change so much
Why the fuck these niggas looking at my chain so much?
They just mad 'cause I departed from the game so much
One false move and the gang gon' bust

Everything custom like I'm at the border, yeah, yeah

Coming with that bullshit, I just put it to the side
Balling since a baby, they could see it in my eyes

Now I can scream that we made it (We made it!)
Now everywhere, everywhere I go, they say 'gratulation (Ooh)
Young nigga, young nigga, graduation (Yeah)

I'm looking for someone to call, baby (Brr)
But right now, I got a situation (Ayy)

But I know I had to have it, yeah
For the money, I'm a savage, yeah
I be itching like a addict, yeah
I'm surrounded, twenty bad bitches, yeah
But they didn't know me last year, yeah
Everyone wanna act like they important (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
But all that mean nothing when I saw my dough, yuh (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Everyone countin' on me, drop the ball, yuh (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Everything custom like I'm at the border, yeah, yeah
If you fuck with winning, put your lighters to the sky
How could I make cents when I got millions on my mind?
Coming with that bullshit, I just put it to the side
Balling since a baby, they could see it in my eyes

[Chorus: Post Malone & Quavo]
My momma called, seen you on TV, son
Said shit done changed ever since we was on
I dreamed it all ever since I was young
They said I wouldn't be nothing
Now they always say, ""Congratulations"" (Congratulations)
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation (Ooh)
They ain't never had the dedication (Uh, uh, ayy)
People hatin', say we changed and look we made it (Uh, uh)
Yeah, we made it (Uh, uh, uh, yeah)

[Verse 2: Quavo]
I was patient (Yeah, oh)
I was patient (Ayy, ooh)
Now I can scream that we made it (We made it!)
Now everywhere, everywhere I go, they say 'gratulation (Ooh)
Young nigga, young nigga, graduation (Yeah)
I pick up the rock and I ball, baby (Ball)
I'm looking for someone to call, baby (Brr)
But right now, I got a situation (Ayy)
Never old Ben-Ben Franklins (Cash)
Big rings (Ooh), champagne (Champagne)
My life is like a ball game (Ball game)
But instead, I'm in the trap though (Trap though)
Pot so big, call it Super Bowl (Super Bowl)
Super Bowl, call the hoes (Brr), get in the Rolls (Skrrt)
Top-floor lifestyle (Top), Huncho and Post (Yeah, ayy)
Malone (Ayy), I gotta play on my phone (Ayy)
You know what I'm on (Ayy), Huncho Houdini is gone (Ayy)

[Chorus: Post Malone & Quavo]

[Intro]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus]
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

[Chorus]
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

[Verse 2]
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know

[Chorus]
Oh, it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

[Bridge]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""
He looks up, grinning like a devil

[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got

How many days did I spend thinking
'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?
Lived in the shade you were throwing
'Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone
And I couldn't get away from ya
In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah
Your name on my lips, tongue-tied
Free rent, living in my mind

But then something happened one magical night

I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet

It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you

Got out some popcorn
As soon as my rep started going down, down, down
Laughed on the school yard
As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground

Would've fought the whole town, so yeah

The moon is high
Like your friends were the night that we first met
Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
Now I've read all of the books beside your bed
The wine is cold
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ayy)
Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night (Oh)
Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times 'cause I waited my whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)

I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

[Verse 2]
In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in first, I went in too
I'm with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brother's wall
Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws
We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so

You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you
Than I was at 16, lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
I'm lost in the lights
American glory faded before me
Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life (Ah)

No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
It's been a long time coming, but

Voted most likely to run away with you

My team is losing, battered and bruising
I see the high fives between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung, you are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories burning before me
I'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?
Darling, I'm scared (Ah)

We could follow the sparks, I'll drive

I whisper in the dark
""Where we gonna go?""
I think he knows

[Verse 1]
We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
""I rent a place on Cornelia Street""
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home

[Chorus]
And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

[Verse 2]
Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone

[Pre-Chorus]
But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I

[Chorus]
I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

[Bridge]
You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago, we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion, listen

[Chorus]
I hope I never lose you
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
Oh, never again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away

I jump from the train, I ride off alone

But who could stay?

The room is on fire, invisible smoke

And you know I love Springsteen, faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey
But something happened, I heard him laughing
I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent
They say home is where the heart is
But that's not where mine lives

You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walking Camden Market in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet

Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you (Ooh)

And now I love high tea, stories from Uni, and the West End
You can find me in the pub, we are watching rugby with his school friends
Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride
Babes, don't threaten me with a good time
They say home is where the heart is
But God, I love the English

[Chorus]
Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
’Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
’Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

[Verse 1]
I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, ""I don't know""
And what once was ours is no one's now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages
But if the story’s over, why am I still writing pages?

[Chorus]
’Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
’Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can’t pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

[Verse 2]
My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
Gave you so much, but it wasn't enough
But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts

[Chorus]
I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
No, it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts (You didn't touch)

[Post-Chorus]
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
My body, my love, my trust (It's death by a thousand cuts)
But it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no

[Outro]
I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, ""I don't know""

Put you in jail for something you didn’t do
I pinned your hands behind your back, oh
Thought I had reason to attack, but no

Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
Chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til there’s no us
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
It's on your face, and I'm to blame, I need to say

[Chorus]
Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don’t wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don’t wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it’s all me, just don't go

It's so excruciating to see you low
Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
This ultraviolet morning light below
Tells me this love is worth the fight, oh

Went off like sirens, just crying

And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Staring out the window like I’m not your favorite town

They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith

[Verse 1: Luke]
Some days, you're the only thing I know
Only thing that's burning when the nights grow cold
Can't look away, can't look away
Beg you to stay, beg you to stay, yeah
Sometimes, you're a stranger in my bed
Don't know if you love me or you want me dead
Push me away, push me away
Then beg me to stay, beg me to stay, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
Call me in the morning to apologize
Every little lie gives me butterflies
Something in the way you're looking through my eyes
Don't know if I'm gonna make it out alive

[Chorus: Luke & All]
Fight so dirty, but your love so sweet
Talk so pretty, but your heart got teeth
Late night devil, put your hands on me
And never, never, never ever let go
Fight so dirty, but your love so sweet
Talk so pretty, but your heart got teeth
Late night devil, put your hands on me
And never, never, never ever let go

[Verse 2: Luke]
Some days, you're the best thing in my life
Sometimes when I look at you, I see my wife
Then you turn into somebody I don't know
And you push me away, push me away, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
Call me in the morning to apologize
Every little lie gives me butterflies
Something in the way you're looking through my eyes

Blood on my shirt, rose in my hand
You're looking at me like you don't know who I am
Blood on my shirt, heart in my hand
Still beating

[Verse 1]
My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight

[Verse 2]
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (Daylight), I only see daylight (Daylight)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight

[Bridge]
And I can still see it all (In my mind)
All of you, all of me (Intertwined)
I once believed love would be (Black and white)
But it's golden (Golden)
And I can still see it all (In my head)
Back and forth from New York (Sneaking in your bed)
I once believed love would be (Burning red)
But it's golden
Like daylight, like daylight
Like daylight, daylight

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
And I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (I see daylight), I only see daylight (Ah)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (Ah)
(And I can still see it all)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(And I can still see it all, back and forth from New York)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight

[Outro]
Like daylight
It's golden like daylight
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Just let it go, let it go

[Spoken Outro]
I wanna be defined by the things that I love
Not the things I hate
Not the things I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of
Or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night
I, I just think that
You are what you love

[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
I don't know where I'm goin'
If  I gotta take the high road, I'm rollin'

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
I  ain't tryna get like all up in your head again, Montana, 'Lanta
Maybe I should just go mosey my ass over to your house
Bewildered by the sight of you up on the couch, so cozy
Lowly  lit lights, rosy cheeks, oh, you so cozy with somebody else
Get  nervous, my stomach churnin', burnin'
I'm beat, ready to knock some teeth out of his ass
Late  night corner, we pass
Lick that Swisher, get red
Used to skip rocks 'round that bend
We don't go there no more
We  don't see sun no more
Baby wanna raid the whole apartment like the FBI
Takin' everything, from pots and pans to fans to Goldeneye
Everything 'cept the dog
Everything in the drawers
Used to be so perfect, but it's never gettin' solved

[Chorus: Deb Never, Merlyn Wood, & Deb Never & Matt Champion]
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help when my
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help when my

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
Do I matter? I'm ecstatic, I'm depressed
More like God's special mess, never had no halo
Trippy, I can barely hike it out of bed
Time bomb under it, persuading you to hop in
Mmm, options, runnin' out of options
Mmm, options, used to have options
Mmm, options, runnin' out of options
Mmm, options, used to have options

[Pre-Chorus: Deb Never & Kevin Abstract]
I don't know where I'm goin'
If I gotta take the high road, I'm rollin'
I don't know where I'm goin'
If I gotta take the high road, I'm rollin'

[Chorus: Deb Never, Merlyn Wood, & Deb Never & Matt Champion]
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help when my
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help when my

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Used to fight all my night terrors, now I smoke through the dreams
Depression put me into places where I'm stuck in the seams
They sealed my mouth and said the only way to breathe is to scream
Pop the stitches from society and fall to my knees
The machines weavin' our fate are gettin' harder to please
But I believe to an extreme
(That we all can find a way)
To anybody listenin' that's in between
(That we all can find a way)

[Verse 4: Joba]
Went to church for the hell of it, stumbled in drunk as shit
Been goin' through it again
Been talkin' to myself, wonderin' who I am
Been thinkin' I am better than Him
In times like these, I just need to believe it's all part of a plan
Lost a part of me, but I am still here

[Bridge: bearface]
Wash it out of all of me to feel the fire (Maybe I'll be gone for a minute)
But you know, you know that's a lie (No one help me when my eyes go)
Wash it out of all of me to feel the fire (Maybe I'll be gone for a minute)
But you know, you know that's a lie (No one help me when my eyes go)

[Chorus: Deb Never, Merlyn Wood, & Deb Never & Matt Champion]
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help me when my
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red

[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
I don't know where I'm goin'
If  I gotta take the high road, I'm rollin'

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
I  ain't tryna get like all up in your head again, Montana, 'Lanta
Maybe I should just go mosey my ass over to your house
Bewildered by the sight of you up on the couch, so cozy
Lowly  lit lights, rosy cheeks, oh, you so cozy with somebody else
Get  nervous, my stomach churnin', burnin'
I'm beat, ready to knock some teeth out of his ass
Late  night corner, we pass
Lick that Swisher, get red
Used to skip rocks 'round that bend
We don't go there no more
We  don't see sun no more
Baby wanna raid the whole apartment like the FBI
Takin' everything, from pots and pans to fans to Goldeneye
Everything 'cept the dog
Everything in the drawers
Used to be so perfect, but it's never gettin' solved

[Chorus: Deb Never, Merlyn Wood, & Deb Never & Matt Champion]
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help when my
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help when my

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
Do I matter? I'm ecstatic, I'm depressed
More like God's special mess, never had no halo
Trippy, I can barely hike it out of bed
Time bomb under it, persuading you to hop in
Mmm, options, runnin' out of options
Mmm, options, used to have options
Mmm, options, runnin' out of options
Mmm, options, used to have options

[Pre-Chorus: Deb Never & Kevin Abstract]
I don't know where I'm goin'
If I gotta take the high road, I'm rollin'
I don't know where I'm goin'
If I gotta take the high road, I'm rollin'

[Chorus: Deb Never, Merlyn Wood, & Deb Never & Matt Champion]
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help when my
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help when my

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Used to fight all my night terrors, now I smoke through the dreams
Depression put me into places where I'm stuck in the seams
They sealed my mouth and said the only way to breathe is to scream
Pop the stitches from society and fall to my knees
The machines weavin' our fate are gettin' harder to please
But I believe to an extreme
(That we all can find a way)
To anybody listenin' that's in between
(That we all can find a way)

[Verse 4: Joba]
Went to church for the hell of it, stumbled in drunk as shit
Been goin' through it again
Been talkin' to myself, wonderin' who I am
Been thinkin' I am better than Him
In times like these, I just need to believe it's all part of a plan
Lost a part of me, but I am still here

[Bridge: bearface]
Wash it out of all of me to feel the fire (Maybe I'll be gone for a minute)
But you know, you know that's a lie (No one help me when my eyes go)
Wash it out of all of me to feel the fire (Maybe I'll be gone for a minute)
But you know, you know that's a lie (No one help me when my eyes go)

[Chorus: Deb Never, Merlyn Wood, & Deb Never & Matt Champion]
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help me when my
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help me when my

Hook up with someone random
This that social awkward suicide
That bite your lips and buy your likes
I swear she had a man
But shit hit different when it's Thursday night

And my friends are all annoying

This that hot girl bummer two-step
They can't box me in, I'm too left
This that drip, it's more like oceans
They can't fit me in a Trojan
Out of pocket, but I'm always in my bag
Yeah, that's the slogan
This that, ""Who's all there?""
I'm pullin' up wit' a emo chick that's broken

[Verse 1]
I like to see everything in neon
Drink  lime green, stay up 'til dawn
Maybe  the way that I'm living is killing me
I like to light up the stage with a song
Do shit to keep me turned on
But  one day I woke up like
""Maybe  I'll do it differently""

[Pre-Chorus]
So I moved to California‚ but it's just a state of mind
It  turns out everywhere you go‚ you take yourself‚ that's not a lie
Wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
It's killing me slowly

[Chorus]
Dream a little dream of me
Make  me into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it‚ I love you
Fuck it, I love you
I really do

[Verse 2]
I used to shoot up my veins in neon
And shit's even brighter; you're gone
So many things I would say to you
I want you

[Pre-Chorus]
You moved to California, but it's just a state of mind
And you know everyone adores you
You can't feel it and you're tired
Baby‚ wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
But it's killing me slowly

Dream a little dream of me
Turn this into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you

It turns out California's more than just a state of mind
I met you on the boulevard, wind through my hair, you blew my mind
And if I wasn't so fucked up, I think I'd fuck you all the time
(I really do)
It's killing me slowly

[Chorus]
Fuck it, I love you (I moved to California, but it's just a state of mind)

Leave you wet like you scuba dived
We were younger then and now we're unified
South London boys, get you crucified, I'm gone

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy]
It's that time
Big Mike and Teddy are on grime
I wanna try new things, they just want me to sing
Because nobody thinks I write rhymes
And now I'm back in the bits with my guy
Give me a packet of crisps with my pint
I hit my friends up, go straight to the pub
'Cause I haven't been home in time, yes, I
But that's my fault (Oh)
Grossed half a billi' on the Divide Tour (Oh)
Yes, I ain't kidding, what would I lie for? (Oh)
But now I'm back on the track with Big Michael (Woah)
He said, ""Teddy, never get off your high horse
And never let 'em take your crown""
I've been away for a while, traveled a million miles
But I'm heading back to London town right now

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy]
Jet plane headed up to the sky (To the sky)
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (Woop, woop)
We ain't hit a rave in a while (In a while)
So take me back to London
Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low (Ceilin' low)
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome (When in Rome)
No town does it quite like my home
So take me back to London

[Verse 3: Stormzy & Ed Sheeran]
Yo, when I squeeze off this little pen of mine
Done the remix, now I got Ed on grime
And this ain't like any top ten of mine
I arrived at Wembley ahead of time
And that's stadiums, man are aliens
I drink supermalts and Vibranium
I got an RM11 titanium
And I rock a 5970 daily, but
I want soul, I want flows
Don't need tags ripping off my clothes
Don't need pricks blowin' up my phone
And Ted said, ""That's just the way things go""
It's just the way things go, amazin' flows
Grime or rap, man, I gave 'em both
Took this sound that was made in Bow
Went global, man, now the case is closed
2015 in a Badingham pub
I told Stormz two years, he'll be wrapping it up
And you'll go through tears with the people you love
But when you get to the top, man, it's never enough
'Cause you can win BRITs (It don't stop)
And you can do Glasto (Headline slot)
But when you're miles away and you're feeling alone
Gotta remember that there ain't no place like home

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy]
Jet plane headed up to the sky (To the sky)
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (Getting high)
We ain't hit a rave in a while (In a while)

So take me back to London

[Verse]
Once upon a time, it was paradise
Once upon a time, I was paralyzed
Think I'm gonna miss these harbor lights
But it's time to let it go
Once upon a time, it was made for us
Woke up one day, it had turned to dust
Baby, we were found, but now we're lost
So it's time to let it go

[Pre-Chorus]
I want my house in the hills
Don't want the whiskey and pills
I don't give up easily
But I don't think I'm down

[Chorus]
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away?

Once upon a time, I was paralyzed
Think I'm gonna miss these harbor lights
But it's time to let it go

Woke up one day, it had turned to dust
Baby, we were found, but now we're lost
So it's time to let it go

Move on, we're not seventeen
I'm not who I used to be
You say that everything changed
You're right, we're grown now

Quickly take off like I'm LeBron

[Intro: Future]
Wheezy outta here

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Yeah, rest in peace to Bankroll‚ show 'em how to do it
Baby goin' crazy‚ he been gettin' straight to it
I done caught so many flights I end up fuckin' all the stewardesses
Catch me in Atlanta‚ no security with my jewelry
Found I was rich, my baby mama talkin' suin' me
'Nother bitch tellin' lies on the pussy like she screwin' me
Catch him down bad, that's his ass‚ nigga, you or me
SI diamonds on the chain, he ain't foolin' me
We was skippin' school on the train‚ duckin' truancy
My main partner turned into a rat, he talkin' 'bout robbin' me
I pray the judge give that boy a bond so I can pop him
We was in the hood, sellin' bags, shootin' choppers
Fucked around and tried to go and lease a helicopter
Baby really a problem, somebody gotta stop him
And the haters watchin' too hard, I think they got binoculars
Every nigga with me on go, it ain't no stoppin' us
Niggas actin' like they got the bag, I'm tryna stop it up
Do this for the bros down the road, gotta lock it up
All you gotta do is say it's smoke, then we're poppin' up
Baby got the streets on hold, he ain't drop yet
I've been goin' hard, it's gon' be hard for you to top that
I make it look easy, but this shit really a process
I'm really a millionaire, still in the projects

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Baby puttin' on for the city
Baby, he the realest, Baby prolly got a couple million
Baby hang with four or five killers
Baby got children, Baby prolly still drug dealin
Baby ain't a trapper, he a rapper
Baby makin' classics, Baby in the hood gettin' active
Baby keep it real with his people
Baby like a preacher, Baby prolly still sell reefer

[Verse 2: DaBaby]
Huh? Baby prolly still got them 'bows
I tell my bitch I'm faithful, but I still got the hoes
Baby gettin' jiggy, on stage with the Glizzy
Baby CEO, he shake the game like he Diddy
You would think it's Mardi Gras, I got these bitches showin' titties
And I ain't throwin' beads, I pull them bitches' weaves
I'm stallin' bitches out, if I'm a dog, then she a flea
And when I fuck her doggystyle the only time I'm on my knee
I barely wanna hit her, got her beggin', ""Baby, please""
I tell a bitch to shut up, you 'bout to fuck my nut up
The label's CEO keep beggin' me to keep the gun up
They know, you play with Baby, Baby beat him, cut up
Private plane, Wi-Fi, on the FaceTime with Johnny
I told him ice my wrist up, I like to hold my fist up
How that boy DaBaby in the air not gettin' his dick sucked?
Why he keep the fire and throw them fours in every picture?
'Cause nigga...

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Baby puttin' on for the city
Baby, he the realest, Baby prolly got a couple million
Baby hang with four or five killers
Baby got children, Baby prolly still drug dealin

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Tell 'em again, tell 'em off (Tell 'em off)
It just dawned on me (On me), what's right, feels wrong
No, no wingman, that's only my A-game
At this game, two can play
Kill your vibe, they don't have the right
Baby don't fight it, you're giving me life
Take your time, set the mood right
Settle down, skeptical at first but now I'm not

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Won't be late, won't delay (Hey)
Won't be late, won't delay (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, yeah, saving my time for you
Suddenly I freed up (Free)
Freezing my times with you
When I'm lonely, I can bring them up
Closed off my line for you (Closing down my line)
I'm better when I'm just on my own, girl
Standing in line for you (Standing in line for you)
Standing here for I don't know how long, girl
Things I wrote (Ayy), lengths I go
Lets you know that I want you
Words we spoke (Yeah), things you wrote
Let me know that you want me too (Yeah)
Ikebe, pressing on me heavy
Pressing up against me real close
Bakasi, moving on me wassy
Time is moving real slow

I started from the bottom, you could see the way I stunt
I want all the diamonds, I want that shit to weigh a ton
The opps, they tryna line me 'cause they hate the place I'm from
But them niggas don't know me, they just know the place I'm from
I got lots of shawties tryna pull up to my place

[Intro: Lil Tecca]
Turn you to a dancer
Yeah
Internet Money, bitch

[Chorus: Lil Tecca]
I got black, I got white, what you want?
Hop outside a Ghost and hop up in a Phantom
I know I'm 'bout to blow, I ain't dumb
They try to take my flow, I take they ass for ransom
I know that I'm gone
They see me blowin' up, now they say they want some
I got two twin Glocks, turn you to a dancer
I see two twin opps, leave 'em on a banner
And I got two thick thots, wanna link the gang, yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Tecca]
I got red, I got blue, what you want?
The Chanel or Balenciaga, Louis and Vuitton
She know I got the Fendi, Prada when I hit Milan
I needed me a die or rider, I need me the one
I started from the bottom, you could see the way I stunt
I want all the diamonds, I want that shit to weigh a ton
The opps, they tryna line me 'cause they hate the place I'm from
But them niggas don't know me, they just know the place I'm from
I got lots of shawties tryna pull up to my place
But you ain't want me last year, so just get up out my face
They all up in my inbox, so I know they want a taste
I know they want my downfall, lil' nigga, are you laced?

[Chorus: Lil Tecca]
I got black, I got white, what you want?
Hop outside a Ghost and hop up in a Phantom
I know I'm 'bout to blow, I ain't dumb
They try to take my flow, I take they ass for ransom
I know that I'm gone
They see me blowin' up, now they say they want some
I got two twin Glocks, turn you to a dancer
I see two twin opps, leave 'em on a banner
And I got two thick thots, wanna link the gang, yeah

[Verse 2: Juice WRLD]
I'm in it to win it, I'ma be the best, yes, sir
Started from the bottom, I ain't have no one, yes, sir
Had to get big on them niggas, Bruce Banner
Bro split wigs, turn a nigga to a dancer
I got hard, I got soft, what you want?
Since the day that I've been on, they been blowing up my phone
I can't hear 'em, I got all this loud in my lungs
Thumbin' through these blue faces while I'm smoking on Runtz
Uh, I'm in the hills (Ooh, yeah), countin' them bills (Ooh, yeah)
All baguette diamonds (Ooh, yeah), chandelier give her chills (Yeah)
Feel like yesterday I was just watching Fresh Prince (Uh)
Now the crib look like Bel-Air, rip to Uncle Phil
Money big, Uncle Phil, twin Glocks, Phil and Lil
Niggas hate, Uncle Tom, spin them off me, carousel
Get 'em off me, go to hell, silencer, kill 'em soft
Tecca'll take you for ransom, me, I'll put you in a coffin

[Chorus: Lil Tecca]
I got black, I got white, what you want?
Hop outside a Ghost and hop up in a Phantom
I know I'm 'bout to blow, I ain't dumb
They try to take my flow, I take they ass for ransom
I know that I'm gone
They see me blowin' up, now they say they want some
I got two twin Glocks, turn you to a dancer

There go lil' mama, I don't wanna fuck her, she burnin', she trippin' (Woah)
I'm wavy, goddamn
Niggas want smoke with the slatt, we can meet in the kitchen (Woah)
I'm burnin' the ham
These so-called gangsters don't know how to approach the man (Totally)
I chop up his ass, I chop up his friends, his mamas, and all his six kids (Woah)

I chop off the top of the Benz and all it gets fierce
They can't wait to shred
I told 'em to chop off your penis, you keeping your head (Chop, I told 'em to do it)
I had a drum with a K and it's fully loaded, nigga play in this bitch (Woah, woah)
Catch him down bad, you know I'm puttin' dick in your wife, I’m not sparing shit (Woah, woah, woah)
Shawty pussy so tight I had to finger her shit with a stick (Totally)
Niggas ain't come from my tribe, I can barely say they hit (Totally)
I need some brand new tires, I done burned off of the Z06 (Skrrt, skrrt)
I know 'bout family ties, I know 'bout the mob, but can't say shit (Shh, shh)
Couple things I done seen in the dark, I know I gotta die with it
Couple mains, I done sent a couple on the Spain, a couple on French (I totally do)

We got some slimy ways, can call up the bro, wipe his nose for a pound (Slatt)
I count it up, see what I made today
Beat it up, you gotta pay to play (Beat it up)
Underdog, I gotta name to save
Some niggas won't ever get out (No, surf)
I'm having major waves (Surf)
Drip like I made the rain (Surf)
Scared and I'm gripping the grain (Surf)
All of this dripping, ain't drain (Surf)
I copped a Bentley Mulsanne, the money been healin' the pain (Yeah)
The coupe the same color cocaine, I hope you don't sniff anything (Yeah)
She say she like giving me brain, I hope you didn't get her a ring
In the Clearport, I'm boarding the plane, G6 is known for a king
Overseas, I got plenty of the tings, all pretty foreign tings
Yves Saint Laurent jeans (Yeah), I drop a four in a cream

[Intro: Young Thug]
(BL$$D)
I just let lil' mama suck me up, girl
Is you tryna cry in a Rolls Royce or the bus‚ girl?
I jumped off the porch and went straight up‚ girl (Straight up‚ girl)
You can leave your town and head to another world

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug]
What the move?
I'm tired of eyein' you
I'm tired of spyin' on you
'Til the pain last too
I made it rain on you
When it was hard to maintain too
I was playin' games with you
Like you could never play games too, woah (Yeah)

[Chorus: Young Thug]
You just gotta tell me what you want (Tell me what you want)
Louis Vuitton, diamonds‚ keep calm (Okay)
All you do is point at what you want (Point it out)
Crystal cut pointers in the charm, c'mon (Oh yeah)
Thirty-five dollars for a duff' (For a duff')
Nigga tryna buy the cash cost (Woo)
Percy Miller, brazy with the woes
Thirty-five dollars for a duff' (For a duff')
You make it twerk for me
You get a purse from me
Eighty thousand dollars for her Birkin
You get a verse for free
I make her worship me
Copy it in bursts for me
Turn to a P-I-M-P‚ I make her work for me
You don't want the bag, oh no, no, no
I make her drop it and pop it and work it on my nose
I make her shut up then suck it, she fuckin' at my shows, mmh
I make her shut up, she fuckin', she suckin' at my shows, ayy

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Drip, drip, no shoestring my sneaker, won't trip
My jeans is so tight they don't fit
Still walk around with a stick on my hip
VVS diamonds right behind my lip
Don't walk with less than fifty on my wrist
Diamonds so cold on my neck, it got me sick
Raf Simons, mix it up with the Rick
Flexin' on these haters who sent me 'my bad'
Made it from the soil, made it from the Rex
Richer than your first, richer than your last
LUV, know I got swag
Pop a rubber band, pop another Xan'
I groove around, party pack my hand
I'm seeing double lookin' through my lens
Tell me what you want, I just want your friend

[Chorus: Young Thug]
You just gotta tell me what you want (Tell me what you want)
Louis Vuitton, diamonds, keep calm (Okay)
All you do is point at what you want (Point it out)

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Diamonds, they drip down my wrist
Let's get it, fuck all the skits, woo
Left wrist sittin' on a brick (Left wrist)
Bitch have it locked like a pick (Sheesh)
Fittz Park, came for the shit
Grab a AK for the wrist
Gorilla, rockin' Bape on a bitch
Potential court case on a bitch (Bitch)
We livin' state to state on a bitch (We livin' state to state, yeah)
We never ever play with the bitch (We never ever play, no)
Do everything the same on a bitch (Never tell the difference)

I'm in another league on a bitch
My diamond 'bout to ski on a bitch (Woo)

I was playin' games with you
Like you couldn't play games too, hey, okay

[Chorus: Young Thug]
You just gotta tell me what you want (Tell me what you want)
Louis Vuitton, diamonds, keep calm (Okay)
All you do is point at what you want (Point it out)

Nigga tryna buy the cash cost (Woo)
Percy Miller, brazy with the woes
Thirty-five dollars for a duff' (For a duff')
You make it twerk for me
You get a purse from me
Eighty thousand dollars for her Birkin
You get a verse for free
I make her worship me
Copy it in bursts for me
Turn to a P-I-M-P, I make her work for me
You don't want the bag, oh no, no, no
I make her drop it and pop it and work it on my nose
I make her shut up then suck it, she fuckin' at my shows, mmh
I make her shut up, she fuckin', she suckin' at my shows, ayy

(BL$$D)
I just let lil' mama suck me up, girl
Is you tryna cry in a Rolls Royce or the bus‚ girl?
I jumped off the porch and went straight up‚ girl (Straight up‚ girl)
You can leave your town and head to another world

I'm tired of spyin' on you
'Til the pain last too
I made it rain on you

Drip, drip, no shoestring my sneaker, won't trip
My jeans is so tight they don't fit
Still walk around with a stick on my hip
VVS diamonds right behind my lip
Don't walk with less than fifty on my wrist
Diamonds so cold on my neck, it got me sick
Raf Simons, mix it up with the Rick
Flexin' on these haters who sent me 'my bad'
Made it from the soil, made it from the Rex
Richer than your first, richer than your last
LUV, know I got swag
Pop a rubber band, pop another Xan'
I groove around, party pack my hand
I'm seeing double lookin' through my lens
Tell me what you want, I just want your friend

Grab a AK for the wrist
Gorilla, rockin' Bape on a bitch
Potential court case on a bitch (Bitch)

[Verse 1]
Isn't it strange that you used to know me?
All the highs and lows and in-betweens
And now you see me and just say, ""Hey""
Isn't it weird that you've seen me naked?
We had conversations 'bout forever
Now it's 'bout the weather‚ okay

[Pre-Chorus]
And I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers in a lifetime
Now just memories
We've gone from strangers to lovers to strangers
Yeah

Acting like we never met
Faking like we'd just forget
We were lovers
And now there's nothing left but small talk
Had every inch of your skin
There's nowhere your hands haven't been
Ain't it funny?
'Cause now there's nothing left but small talk

[Verse 2]
Isn't it wild that I know your weakness?
And everybody at the party thinks
That you're the best since sliced bread
And isn't it awkward I got a new somebody?
And honestly it'll probably be a while before we can just be friends

Ooh

[Verse 1: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Watch  'nother Richard
It's  a million plus three reasons I lied
I couldn't admit it
And I just don't want you to waste my time
'Cause  I'm tryna get with ya
I  be feelin' down but I'm fine when I'm with ya
You be thinkin' I be lyin' when I say I miss you
Girl,  you know I'm on your body, on your body like a tissue
They be callin' you Illuminati when I'm with you (Illuminati when I'm with you)
I say, ""Maybe, it's your third eye,"" I love your mental (Third eye, I love your mental)
VVS's on me look like Now and Laters, lick you up
I  bet you never go back to the guy that was with you (Guy that was with you)
She got every pair of Chanel out of SoHo
Tribeca, hit the city to show off
And when you get dressed up, you take hours
Baby girl, you know you can do whatever, you got...

[Verse 2: Khalid]
Power
Got me sittin' by my phone, I've been waiting for hours
On my line, sending mirror pics of you fresh out the shower
So I might as well swing over to your place, mmh, nah
It's crowded
In LA, but I'll be there at 8 if the traffic allows it
Say you're down, I could show you around if you're really about it, yeah
But for you, I got something to prove, what do you say?
What do you say?

[Chorus: Khalid]
Should we bring it right back?
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right back

[Verse 3: Khalid]
Saved
Got the weed, we can sit by the beach if we wanna get faded
But if that's not the vibe, yeah, it's cool
We can save it for later, yeah
I just like the way it feels when you're around
When you're around, ah
Now I know we're not dating, nah
Maybe soon by the way things go, we've been talking for ages
Take it step by step, slow it down, we just need to be patient, love
If the love feels good and it's real, it'll all work out
It'll all work out, yeah

And every breath that I've been taking

That you'll come back when you can find some peace
'Cause every word that I've heard spoken
Since you left feels like a hollow street

But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind

And if only I could hold you

[Verse 1]
Counting days, counting days
Since my love up and got lost on me
And every breath that I've been taking
Since you left feels like a waste on me
I've been holding on to hope
That you'll come back when you can find some peace
'Cause every word that I've heard spoken
Since you left feels like a hollow street

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind
Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side

[Chorus]
There must be something in the water
'Cause every day, it's getting colder
And if only I could hold you
You'd keep my head from going under

Maybe I, maybe I'm just being blinded
By the brighter side
Of what we had because it's over
Well, there must be something in the tide

[Letra de ""CANGURO""]

[Intro]
Hoy no voy a salir y voy a quedarme en la' nube' donde nadie sube

[Estribillo]
(Uah) No vengas a molestar, dicen que está todo mal‚ bueno
(Uah) Yo estoy más que bien acá y no te pienso ni mirar‚ ciego
Vamo'‚ repriman la mierda que tienen guardada en el pecho
Traguen y callen hasta estar desecho', párense siempre derecho
""Cállenlo, sédenlo‚ que haga lo que quiera, pero sáquenlo"" y
""Cállenlo, sédenlo‚ que haga lo que quiera, pero sáquenlo""
Ey, háganme caso, ¿o no tienen claro que soy el rey?
Háganme caso que soy la ley, dame mis blíster', mis Parisiennes, wah

[Verso 1]
Patada de canguro, golpe duro
No vamo' a parar con esto, negro, te lo juro
Traje cianuro pa' meterle' en el trago
Cinco minuto' acá y ya estamo' causando estragos
Un mago nos quiere hacer desaparecer
Pero esta plaga rara nunca para de crecer
Somo' de los pocos locos que andan buscando placer
Y aunque quieran vernos roto', no damo' brazo a torcer
No para de toser, trabajando doce hora'
Cobra dos moneda' al mes pa' mantener cuatro persona'
Y no hables de meritocracia, me da gracia, no me joda'
Que sin oportunidades esa mierda no funciona
Y no, no hace falta gente que labure más
Hace falta que con menos se pueda vivir en paz
Mandale gas, no te perdás, acordate dónde estás
Fijate siempre de qué lado de la mecha te encontrás

[Verso 2]
Dice: ""What up? Esto pega como coca""
La gente baila loca, el cuello se disloca
La droga en lo' dedo', que vaya de boca en boca
Sentís como te choca, esa vaina subió la nota
Salto como una pulga, empezó la purga
Largo todo fresco como un PXXR GVNG, hijo de-
Otra vez con sed entre fiebres y migraña'
Vuelvo a soñar con un viejo en el medio de una montaña
Me miró y me dijo: ""De la vida nadie se salva
Y eso de la juventud es solo una actitud del alma""
Qué virtud extraña, ahora me queman las entrañas
Mi mejor conversación la tuve ayer con una araña
No sé qué hora es, ni me interesa
Acá siempre son 4:20, y estamo' de la cabeza, con simpleza
Birra barata y mala en lata, má' la planta santa esa
La que calma el cuerpo y te lo desestresa
El hood está de fiesta, el culo se te tensa
Entiendo que te molesta, la empatía te cuesta
Y si ahora gritamo' y cantamo' en modo de protesta
Es porque preguntamo' bien y nadie nos dio una respuesta
Se creen dueños, salgan del medio, lo digo en serio
Fuera la yuta que meten al barrio, le tira a los pibe' y le mata los sueño'
Bueno, juego, del underground, del agujero
Estamo' agitando de nuevo, sacando pa' afuera a eso' carroñero', ñero

[Letra de ""Si Se Da (Remix)"" ft. Sech & Zion]

[Intro: Sech]
(This is the remix)
Otra noche que llamó pa' verme
Tiene kush y haze también, pero sola no prende

[Refrán: Zion]
(Z-Diddy)
Dice que no fuma, pero si yo prendo, ella le da, ella le da
Me dio un beso y le sentí allá abajo la humedad, uh-yeh
Es como andar en el mar navegando a ciegas
Eres una fantasma y no dejas que te vea

[Coro: Myke Towers & Farruko]
Eso le da cuando está en la soledad
Se castiga sin piedad, tú te viene' y te va'
Ella y las amiga' son una sociedad
Y saben lo que va a pasar con los mío' si se da (Pu-pum)
Eso le da cuando está en la soledad
Se castiga sin piedad, tú te viene' y te va' (Viene' y te va')
Ella y las amiga' son una sociedad
Y saben lo que va a pasar con los mío' si se da

[Verso 1: Sech]
(Este es Se')
Es que si se da después del concierto
Quedamo' adentro de tu apartamento
Tú no ere' de aquí, lo noto por tu acento
No es amor, pero grita: ""¡Lo siento!""
Yo no soy de darle repeat, siempre lo escribo en lo' tweet'
Voy a hacer un tutorial pa' que te olvides de mí
Que no me saca de su mente, que regrese, que quedó caliente
Otra noche que llamó pa' verme
Tiene kush y haze también, pero sola no prende

[Verso 2: Myke Towers]
La ma'i también 'tá dura y eso ella lo va a heredar (Je)
Estos bobo' me tiran, después quieren arreglar
La envidian, pero saben que no le van a llegar
A mí me da igual lo que ellos quieran alegar
'Tamos bebiendo Cognac y quemando moñas
En billetes de cien e' que ella desenmoña
Las otras bailando a tu la'o parecen momias
Y a mí no se me olvida cómo yo te comía, todavía eres mía
Eso era, ¿cuáles son tus fantasías?
Y yo sin pensarlo, baby, te lo hacía
Yo te doy lo que tú exijas, la champaña está fría
Oye, si tú la deja', ella sola la vacía

[Puente: Myke Towers]
Yo te doy lo que tú pida', pero no te me aproveches
En una semana, la vi como ocho vece'
¿Dónde quieres que te escriba? (¿En dónde, bebé?)
¿Por el Instagram o iMessage?
Frente a la gente no dejo que me besen

[Coro: Zion]
(Zion, baby)
Eso le da cuando está en la soledad
Se castiga sin piedad, tú te vienes y te va' (No)
Ella y las amiga' son una sociedad
Y saben lo que va a pasar con los mío' si se da, ay, ay

[Verso 3: Zion]
Esta noche se vistió provocante
Un vestido pa' que yo se lo levante
Se nota que le gustan los cantante'
Porque siempre pide que le cante
Zun Da Da, ya tiene la espalda sudada de tanto bailarme así
Juraba que no tenía maldad, pero cuando le da se transforma
Se suelta, comienza a perder la paciencia
Mientras que me besa salvaje
No pone resistencia y lo hace sin prudencia
Loca porque le quite el traje
Me pide que le hable con autoridad
Que esta noche yo seré su prioridad
Que está cansada de la soledad
Por esa le da con llamarme

[Coro: Sech]
Eso le da cuando está en la soledad
Se castiga sin piedad, tú te viene' y te va' (Te va')
Ella y las amiga' son una sociedad
Y saben lo que va a pasá' con lo' mío' si se da

[Verso 4: Arcángel]
(Auh; yah)
Y si la cosa se da y tengo la oportunidad
Y se te da un poquito más de lo que das
Entonce', yo te voy a dar tan duro
Que va' a terminar diciendo: ""Ya no más"" (Jaja)
Ven y pruébame, y verás de lo que yo soy capaz
Que estoy duro en la cama luego dirás (Yah; Austin, baby)
Esta noche, vamos privado, olvídate del first class
Hoy tú andas con una estrella fugaz (Así que pide más)
Ponte creativa, activa tu curiosidad
Dale espacio a que brille en ti toda esa vanidad (Yah)
Tú andas suelta, finísima, riquísima
Soltera, solicitada y pa' colmo, putísima (Auh)

[Coro: Arcángel & Myke Towers]
Eso le da cuando está en la soledad
Se castiga sin piedad, tú te viene' y te va' (Lama)
Ella y las amiga' son una sociedad
Y saben lo que va a pasar con los mío' si se da (Young Kingz)
Eso le da cuando está en la soledad
Se castiga sin piedad, tú te viene' y te va'

[Verso 5: Farruko]
(Pri, yah, yah, yah, ¡Farru'!)
Y si se da, baby, te sacaste la loto
Porque ando con pa'l de peso' y hoy contigo los exploto (¡Pa!)
Dile a tu amiga que dejé de estar grabando
Que no sea peliculera y deje 'e estar tirando foto' (Jajaja)
Que andamo' rulay, pide que hay
Aquí tengo pa'l de moña' y el Blue me lo bajo straight (Pu-pu-pum)
La galla anda activa, yo también activo
Y estoy loco 'e pillarla y de guayarle el estribo (Tra, tra)
A ver si como ronca se menea, la abusadora
Estoy que la secuestro y me la llevo de aquí ahora (¡Pa!)
A ver si e' verdá' que ella está pa' mí o se pegó a chapiar al VIP
Y no caliente' la comida si no te la va' a comer
Ya tú no ere' una nena, baby, tú ere' una mujer
Sabes que si me pego te tiene' que ir a to'a

That's the shit I'm talking 'bout though, like you changed up, you don't even fuckin' link nobody no more, you just dash me away like a cyattie. Yo, you cheesed me dog

[Verse 1]
Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture
Crazy how you gotta wait until it's dark out to see who really with you
Crazy how even when it miss you
Shit'll come back around and get you
Crazy like all my niggas, crazy like all my niggas
Remember I deleted all my other girls' numbers out the phone for you?
Remember when you had to take the bar exam
I drove in the snow for you? Yeah
You probably don't remember half the shit a nigga did for you, yeah

Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then
But how 'bout now? (Now)
'Cause I'm up right now (I'm up right now)

Oh, you thought you had it all figured out back then
But how 'bout now? (Now)

How 'bout now? Yeah

[Verse 2]
Yeah, always been daddy's little angel
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas
He ain't even say thank you
I had no money left from actin', I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit
You be like ""who's this?"" I be like ""me, girl""
You be like ""oh, word, true shit?""
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
Them car rides made me feel like I was losin' it
Yeah, made me feel I ain't have it like that
Or I was average like that
Started drinkin' way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I'm not even Christian, I still went to church that year
Guess I just had to pretend that year
I ain't even see my friends that year
Places that I should've been

[Intro]

Aw yeah, aw yeah
Call up on drank and let's
Let's call up and, uh

[Interlude]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
I don't really give a fuck and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older, somebody should've told you
I'm on one (Ayy), fuck it, I'm on one (Yeah)
I said I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one, a strong one
Two white cups and I got that drink
It could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got, and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one
Aw yeah, aw yeah
You know what I'm
Oh yes, oh yeah
Oh yes, oh yeah
Uh, oh yes, oh yeah
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
You know what I'm sipping, I'll teach you how to mix it
But you're the only one 'cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches, they might catch me slipping
So you're the only one, 'cause I don't trust these bitches
They might, they might catch me slipping and put in something different
So you're the only one, 'cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches, they might catch me slipping
So you're the only one

On drank and let's all get faded, yeah, uh

[Verse 2]
Drizzy Drake, check me out
Coming live from the motherfuckin' North Side
Kick game, run game, run it real good
But never ever have my bitches sitting courtside
Same nigga that you knew way back when
You acting like it's somebody you don't know
Tell me, how the fuck we 'posed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show?
I could tell, I could tell, I could tell
Certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more
Guess that they don't really make 'em like me no more, uh
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
'Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself
But still, let them girls in and tell 'em all
Leave them cell phones on the table where we see them
I'm all day with it, man, AM to the PM
Niggas hating, I just wish that they would say it when they see him, oh

[Bridge]
That's that shit that drives me crazy
And it's all that I've been getting lately
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in
Women want to fuck like they're me and I'm them
Looking for some things and I think that I can find 'em in you, in you

Let's call up and, uh

[Interlude]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
I don't really give a fuck and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older, somebody should've told you
I'm on one (Ayy), fuck it, I'm on one (Yeah)
I said I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one, a strong one
Two white cups and I got that drink
It could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got, and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one
Aw yeah, aw yeah
You know what I'm
Oh yes, oh yeah
Oh yes, oh yeah
Uh, oh yes, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
You know what I'm sipping, I'll teach you how to mix it
But you're the only one 'cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches, they might catch me slipping
So you're the only one, 'cause I don't trust these bitches
They might, they might catch me slipping and put in something different
So you're the only one, 'cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches, they might catch me slipping

Drizzy Drake, check me out
Coming live from the motherfuckin' North Side
Kick game, run game, run it real good
But never ever have my bitches sitting courtside
Same nigga that you knew way back when
You acting like it's somebody you don't know
Tell me, how the fuck we 'posed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show?
I could tell, I could tell, I could tell
Certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more
Guess that they don't really make 'em like me no more, uh
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
'Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself
But still, let them girls in and tell 'em all

Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)

[Verse 1: Drake]
I got car money, fresh start money
I want Saudi money, I want art money
I want women to cry and pour out they heart for me
And tell me how much they hate it when they apart from me
Yeah, and lately I do bitches the meanest
Tell 'em I love 'em and don't ever mean it
We go on dates, I send the Maybach out in neighborhoods
They never seen it
That shit is dangerous, but it's so convenient, I ain't lying
Yeah, and comfortable I sit
That manual Ferrari Italia's some fly shit
It's sitting at the house like I bought it in '96
'Cause honestly I'm too fucking busy to drive stick, I swear
Too fucking busy, too busy fuckin'
This nigga girl, but to me she wasn't
Been hot before they open doors for me, pre-heated oven
I'm in this ho
But I ain't finished though, it's been a minute though
My newest girl from back home got issues with parents
And some charges, how the fuck can I get her to Paris?
Luckily, I'm the greatest my country's ever seen
So chances are I get the border to issue me clearance
Dreams money can buy
Everybody yelled ""Surprise!"", I wasn't surprised
That's only 'cause I been waiting on it, nigga
So fuck whoever hating on a nigga
Of course...

We talked music for hours, she never mentioned ya
Can't tell you how much I love when niggas think they got it
And I love the fact that line made 'em think about it
YMCMB
These niggas make it so hard to be friendly
When I know part of it's envy
Tryna fill the shoes, nigga, so far, these are empty
I take 'em off in the house because the throw carpets are Fendi
Ooh! I never seen the car you claim to drive
Or, shit, I seen it; you just ain't inside
And I feel like lately, it went from top five to remaining five
My favorite rappers either lost it or they ain't alive
And they tryna bring us down, me, Weezy, and Stunna
We stayed up, Christmas lights in the middle of summer
And if the girl standing next to me got a fat ass
Then I'll probably give her my number
Yeah, I throw my dollars up high
And they land on the stage you dance on
We got company coming over
Would it kill you to put some pants on?
Dreams money can buy
They told me it's like a high, and it wasn't a lie, yeah
Just have some good pussy waiting on a nigga
And fuck whoever hating on a nigga

Glock .40, he got smokey, yeah, the draco
Thousand nights on that corner eatin' egg rolls
Bad bitch Puerto Rican, look like J. Lo, woah
They tried to extort me, I ain't pay though
Only thing I gave ’em was a halo
A-hole, Uber on the way, ho
Fuck her from the back, put my thumb all in her A-hole
I got bands for real, diamonds on me, they dance for real
All these sticks and drums, bangin' like we in a band for real
I got cake, I stay humble, know I'm the man for real
I got hitters, we don't rumble, tell your mans to chill
Yo, who's mans is this? (Somebody come get this nigga)
All up in my section Instagrammin' shit
I be with some real hitters, they ain't with that camera shit
'Cause they really out here in the field and they be slammin’ shit

Take them shackles off his feet, he ain't a slave (Slave)
Growin’ up in the hood, you don't learn how to behave ('Have)
How we gon' learn to stack if we ain't got nothin' to save? (Save)
Got a little bad bitch, got some work done on her butt (On her butt)
Gotta catch another flight as soon as I catch my nut (Catch my nut)
Just bein' honest, Meek was the first to show me love (Show me love)
And the first time that I seen a Maybach was with cuz (Cuz)
Gettin' these bags, we might as well tell our opps what's up (What's up)

Yo, who's mans is this? (Somebody come get this nigga)
All up in my section Instagrammin' shit
I be with some real hitters, they ain't with that camera shit
'Cause they really out here in the field and they be slammin’ shit

[Chorus: NAV]
Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap
Giving head taps, lead tat, tat, tats
They said that they were with it but it’s cap, cap, cap
Aimin' at your fitted, push it back, back, back
Whack, whack, whack, whack, whack
One phone call get you whacked, whacked, whacked
Try to slap me, we gon’ let it slap, slap, slap
Cross a line, it's too late, you can't take it back, back, back (Yeah)

[Verse 2: NAV]
They got my brother locked inside a cage (In a cage)
Take them shackles off his feet, he ain't a slave (Slave)
Growin’ up in the hood, you don't learn how to behave ('Have)
How we gon' learn to stack if we ain't got nothin' to save? (Save)
Got a little bad bitch, got some work done on her butt (On her butt)
Gotta catch another flight as soon as I catch my nut (Catch my nut)
Just bein' honest, Meek was the first to show me love (Show me love)
And the first time that I seen a Maybach was with cuz (Cuz)
Gettin' these bags, we might as well tell our opps what's up (What's up)
Got weddin' bands but I still don't got a bitch to cuff
In every city I go, they already know what's up (What's up)
I got resources, I could get straight to the plug

[Chorus: NAV]
Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap
Giving head taps, lead tat, tat, tats
They said that they were with it but it's cap, cap, cap
Aim it at your fitted, push it back, back, back
Whack, whack, whack, whack, whack
One phone call get you whacked, whacked, whacked
Try to slap me, we gon' let it slap, slap, slap
Cross a line, it's too late, you can't take it back, back, back (Yeah)

[Verso 1: Romeo Santos]
Cuando una mujer decide ser mala y no quiere dueño
Probablemente un hombre la engañó en su vida, sin sentimientos
Rumba, el pasado lo enterró en la tumba
La mala tiene vida, la buena es la difunta
Ahora, pal' carajo la envidia de todas
Todo bobolon que se le acerque ella lo ignora
Tan callaí'ta que era la nena
Ahora es candela
La veo cazando con veinte botellas
Presiento un problema
Yo soy servicial con sus deseos
Si me pide como R Kelly yo la- (Nasty)
No me gustan chamaquitas
Solo hago lo que la bebé le excita
Él le falló-ó-ó y la traicionó-ó-ó
Ahora ella va a vengarse en mi cama

[Coro: Anuel AA]
Ella quiere beber, ella quiere bailar
Su novio la dejó y lo quiere olvidar
Ella se entregó y el tipo le falló
Y por eso se va a rumbear (Rumbear)
Ella quiere beber, ella quiere bailar
Su novio la dejó y lo quiere olvidar
Ella se entregó y el tipo le falló
Y por eso se va a rumbear

[Verso 2: Anuel AA, Anuel AA & Romeo Santos]
En el Phantom yo te voy a buscar
Baby, tú nunca me va' a olvidar (Bebé)
Yo necesito que me enseñe' a amar (Amar)
Bebecita, yo te vo' a devorar
Bebecita, tu cuerpo y tú a mí me excitan (uah)
Por dentro tu me necesita'
Tú siempre va' a ser mi diablita
Mi loquita, mojaíta'
Tu cuerpo y tú a mí me excitan
Por dentro tú me necesita'
Tú siempre va' a ser mi diablita
Mi loquita, bien bonita

[Coro: Romeo Santos]

Y por eso se va a rumbear

[Verso 3: Anuel AA]
Ella me miraba desde lejo'
Bailando en un hilito de Romeo (uah)
Nunca escuchaba lo' consejo'
En sus ojos siempre veo mis reflejos
Le falló-ó-ó y la traicionó-ó-ó
Ella se emborrachó-ó y conmigo se escapó-ó-ó
Veinte botella', champaña rosada
La bebecita me deseaba (uah)
Una diablita, ella me devoraba (uah)
Y yo adentro 'e su piel
Me enterraba (uah)
Dios mío, qué rico, baby (baby)
Su cuerpo se apodera de mí (de mí)
Temblando en un orgasmo pa' mí (pa' mí)

[Intro: Sech, Nicky Jam, Ozuna, Anuel AA & *Darell*]
Sigue aquí tomándose otro tra–
(¡This is the remix!)
La vida para ti no ha sido fácil
Ha sido, en el amor, muy demasia'o difícil
Hay algo en él que ya no te complace (-place)
Por eso sale y hace lo que hace (Woh, oh)
La vida es una y el tiempo no va a parar
Te lo digo porque he visto cómo se pierde amando (Amando, oh)
Bebé, yo creo, el tiempo se está acabando
Te cambió siendo mejor que ella (No-no-no, no-oh-oh)
Por mujeres y un par de botella' (De botella'; no-no-no, no-oh-oh)
Por amigos que no son amigos en verdá' (Ah, ah; ice)
Porque sé que te van a escribir cuando él se va
(Uah, uah; *everybody go to the discotek!*)

[Pre-Coro: Anuel AA, Sech & Darell]
Y ahora a lo oscuro y sin disimulo (Eso e' así)
Olvidando la' pena' la pillé (Uah-ah-ah; ¡ah!)
Ahora hace lo que quiere cuando quiere (Oh-oh)
Y si no quiere, eres otro que se jode también (Here we go again!)

[Coro: Sech, Ozuna, Anuel AA & Darell]
Cuando el DJ pone la música (Eso e' así)
Ella baila como nunca (Real hasta la muerte, baby; pa' que sepa)
Y ahora a lo oscuro (Oh-oh), y sin disimulo (Oh-oh)
Olvidando la' pena' la pillé (¡Ra-ta-ta-tá!)
Cuando el DJ pone la música
Ella baila como nunca (The Real Rondón)
Ahora hace lo que quiere cuando quiere
Y si no quiere, eres otro que se jode también

[Verso 1: Anuel AA]
La dejaron sola y rompe con la batidora
Un perreo sin censura, por un hombre ella no llora (Ella no llora)
No confía en nadie, nadie (Nadie)
Hoy se bebe y pa' la calle, calle (Calle)
Ella quiere beber, ella quiere bailar (Bailar)
Y quiere fumar y se va a emborrachar (-borrachar, ah-ah)
Ya ella no ama y no llama y tampoco reclama
Y la busco en la Lambo' y rompemo' la cama

[Verso 2: Nicky Jam]
E-e-e-e-e-es que no quiero hablar de él, vamo' pa' la pared (Pared)
Pa' lo oscuro, pa' ver lo que tú sabe' (Sabe')
Me está' pidiendo pon, pero aquí no cabe (Cabe)
Quiso perder el ritmo y tengo la clave, yeh-yeh-yeh
¿Tú quiere' ver cómo le meto bien duro? (Duro)
Dale, ma', es que yo estoy sin seguro
Cuando yo estoy contigo, siempre yo me curo, yeah
Eso e' mío, te lo juro

Que quiere pa' lo oscuro, pero que lo haga con disimulo
Me dijo que tiene un novio rudo
Que por qué yo llego y no saludo
Le dije: ""Tú perdóname, bebé, no soy gris, yo soy negro oscuro""
Que suene el bajo, que te quiero ver
Sudando, baby, hasta el amanecer
Hay otra baby que me quiere ver, tú tiene' que saber
Pero, tranquila, que la estoy pasando bien, tú también
No importa, baby, lo que diga quién (Lo que diga quién)
Yo sé que él a ti no te valora (Valora)
Pero yo no estoy pa' amor ahora, baby
Disfruta y no mire' la hora (La hora)
Sólo con tu última enamora', lady (Lady)

Woh-woh-woh, stop that shit, nigga
Ahora pa' ella los días son grise' (Eso e' así)
Porque su' mañana' no son felice' (¡Hah!)
Lo que eran beso', ahora son cicatrice' (Pa' que sepa)
Está soltera y pa' la calle dice (¡Ra-ta-ta-tá!)
Deja que yo te coja y te monte en la Mercede' roja (Eso e' así; roja)
Voy a que eso abajo se te moja (Se te moja; ¡ah!)
Pa' que conmigo 'tés sonrojá' (Here we go again!)
Mientra' de to' lo malo te despoja
Hazle las maleti, que hace tiempo que se olvidó de ti (Eso e' así)
Yo quiero financiarte, ma', yo quiero darte el peti' (Oh-oh)
Tú 'tás linda con tu cuerpecito petite (¡Ah!)
Y esa barriguita con más cuadrito que Tetri'

Cuando el DJ pone la música, música (-ca)
Ella se va hasta abajo con toda su gang (Woh, oh)
Ahora baila, fuma, toma sola
Llega a la casa y no le dicen na'
Qué vida, pa' que nunca se le acabe a ella ('Tá)
'Tá borracha, pero pide otra botella (Ah-ah-ah)
Es que a esa hora tiene la nota en alta
La felicidad en ella resalta

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah
I'm home now, it's over now, so...
Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
She got a thing for Chanel vintage that dropped before she could speak English
Do you love me or love seekin' attention, I mean which one is it?
You keep callin' me ya twin, but twins ain't this different
Mentally I'm already on next year, that's some 20/20 clear vision
You sayin' let you finish, I ain't tryna hear it
I'm all for spiritual liftin', but I don't fly Spirit
I'm all for findin' happiness, but down to die serious
All smiles, Kevin Durant trials
Had to blow it on the court, I must have blew a milli'
I'm walkin' on all charges, that's my new Achilles
I know they love to rock a check, but who gon' do it really? Really?
My depositions never surface
Tanenbaum know the logo on the jersey, it's gettin' purchased
Ten years in and y'all yet to hear my most impressive verses
Paid the cost to be the boss wasn't even my most expensive purchase
Trust when I say I'm never on the shit they assumin' I'm on
Tales about me are like corridos in Culiacán
Sashimi from Saito, you know that man two Michelin Star
Postcard from Grace Bay, sendin' my distant regards
Vision wasn't mine, told my niggas the vision was ours
Still a part of shorty even if we've been livin' apart
Roxx'll do you filthy for me soon as I give him the nod
Meanin' he'll blast for me like puttin' the 6 with the God
Hop on a float to show the city the one they appointed
The one that's rebuildin' schools and feedin' the homeless
Hang with my niggas, but sometimes I be tryna avoid it
'Cause they'll get to poppin' out of place like they double jointed
Goals was the top of the pyramid in this shitty world
""I gotta get the most of everything"" is the axis on which it sit and twirls
Point blank period, like a City Girl and then I bring it back to 50 world

[Chorus: Drake & Rick Ross]
Ayy, woah
You made me this way, yeah
Before I'm gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my vase, won't you?
Let me know that I did okay, yeah
Don't wait 'til some other day, no, no
They love to wait 'til it's too late, it's too late
This different right here, yo

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I was nominated, never won a Grammy
But I understand, they'll never understand me
Lot of lives lost, but I never panicked
Lot of lines crossed, I never did a Xanny
A hundred room mansion but I felt abandoned
Love makin' love, but where will love land me?
Jealous, so their bitches be actin' like they sleepin' on us
But they speakin' on us, jewelers quote us even numbers
Still blowin' smoke as angels float above us
Love givin' back, but will they ever love us?
Chanel in the mail, FedEx from Pharrell
And what I got for sale just sit on the scale
Triple beam dream, a buck on the shades
I really seen things give mothers the shakes
I really bought cars for women on face
I know it seem odd, but money amazin'
College loans really did fuck up her credit
Discover cards, look back, I know she regret it
But we keep pushin', keep our foot on the pedal
In the mirror she a blessin', rebukin' the devil
Livin' on the edge, she keepin' me level
Money come and go, I'ma keep you forever
Money come and go, I'ma keep you forever (Forever)
Slip-on glass slippers and tickle with feathers
Everywhere we go, we create a dilemma
Coming to America, really the set
I'll let your soul glow, I'm keepin' you wet
All my cold Decembers, I know she remembers
Forgiveness for a sinner, but is it that simple?
Holdin' on your hands, your body's a temple
Fly you out to Cannes, ménages with bitches
Lobsters and the prawns, thought you was Spanish
Bottles for the Don, our parties the biggest (Biggest, biggest)
(Maybach Music)

[Chorus: Drake]
Ayy, woah
You made me this way, yeah
Before I'm gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my vase, won't you?
Let me know that I did okay, yeah
Don't wait 'til some other day, no, no
They love to wait 'til it's too late, too late (Ayy)

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Had a dream she was singin' to me like Gladys Knight
True love in the projects is called paradise
All your niggas left, you wasn't actin' right
But honesty itself a small sacrifice
My money bag heavy, got me packin' light
You movin' funny, can you fill my appetite?
Niggas' conversations, a lot of it false
He own condos right over Carnegie Hall
Speak about your cars, but all of 'em parked
Your niggas' money light, come out of the dark
You really are my type, that's not a facade
One of the reasons why I write, we got a synopsis
I'm always at the top of barbershop gossip
After further thought, better not knock 'em
Allocate some dollars to go out shoppin'
Bitch, we on the real, it's time to stop talkin' (Stop talkin', stop talkin')

[Chorus: Drake]
Ayy, woah
You made me this way, yeah
Before I'm gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my vase, won't you?

Well, my piggy bank is hungry, my nigga, you need to feed it
If the text ain't freaky, I don't wanna read it
And just to let you know, this punani is undefeated, ayy
He said he really wanna see me more
I said, ""We should have a date—where? At the Lamborghini store""
I’m kinda scary, hard to read, I'm like a Ouija board
But I'm a boss bitch, who you gonna leave me for?
You hoes got no class, you bitches is broke still
I be talking cash, shit, while I'm popping my gold grill
I'm a whole rich bitch, and I work like I'm broke still
But the love be so fake, but the hate be so real, uh

[Intro: Ozuna]
Wo-oh, oh-oh

[Coro: Ozuna]
Báilame como si fuera la última vez (Oh)
Y enséñame ese pasito que no sé (Yeah-yeah)
Un besito bien suavecito, bebé
Taki taki, taki taki, ¡rumba!
Wo-oh, oh-oh
Hi Music Hi Flow (Snake; jaja)
Báilame como si fuera la última vez (Oh-oh)
Y enséñame ese pasito que no sé (Oh-oh)
Un besito bien suavecito, bebé
Taki taki (Oh-oh)
Taki taki (Yeah-yeah)

[Verso 1: Ozuna]
Taki taki, quiere un besito o un ñaqui
Booty explota como Nagasaki (-aki)
Prende los motores Kawasaki (Kawasaki)
Que la disco está llena y llegaron los Anunnakis (Eh-eh)
No le bajes

[Pre-Coro: Ozuna]
El booty sobresale de tu traje
No trajo pantisito pa' que el nene no trabaje
Es que yo me sé lo que ella cree que ella se sabe
Cuenta que no quiere pero me tiene espionaje, eh-eh
El booty sobresale de tu traje
No trajo pantisito pa’ que el nene no trabaje
Es que yo me sé lo que ella cree que ella se sabe
Cuenta que no quiere pero me tiene espionaje, eh-eh

[Coro: Ozuna]
Báilame como si fuera la última vez
Y enséñame ese pasito que no sé
Un besito bien suavecito, bebé
Taki taki, taki taki, ¡rumba!
Wo-oh, oh-oh
Hi Music Hi Flow

[Verso 2: Cardi B]
Bardi (Cardi)
He said he wanna to touch it, and tease it, and squeeze it
Well, my piggy bank is hungry, my nigga, you need to feed it
If the text ain't freaky, I don't wanna read it
And just to let you know, this punani is undefeated, ayy
He said he really wanna see me more
I said, ""We should have a date—where? At the Lamborghini store""
I’m kinda scary, hard to read, I'm like a Ouija board
But I'm a boss bitch, who you gonna leave me for?
You hoes got no class, you bitches is broke still
I be talking cash, shit, while I'm popping my gold grill
I'm a whole rich bitch, and I work like I'm broke still
But the love be so fake, but the hate be so real, uh

[Pre-Coro: Cardi B]
El booty sobresale de mi traje
No traje pantisito pa' que el nene no trabaje
E' que yo me sé lo que tú cree’ que tú no sabe’
Dice que no quiere, pero se quiere comer el equipaje

[Coro: Ozuna & Selena Gomez]
Báilame como si fuera la última vez
Y enséñame ese pasito que no sé
Un besito bien suavecito, bebé
Taki taki, taki taki, ¡rumba!
Wo-oh, oh-oh (DJ Snake)

[Verso 3: Selena Gomez]
Careful when you come through my way
My body already know how to play
Work it, keep it tight everyday
And I, I, I know you need a taste
When I ooh, you're fallin’ in love
Give a little ooh-ooh, get it well done
Dancing on my ooh, make your girl wanna run
We keep moving 'til the sun come up
Porque I am the party, yo soy fiesta
Blow out your candles, have a siesta
They can try, pero no one can stop me
What my taki taki wants, yeah, my taki taki gets, uh

[Coro: Selena Gomez & Ozuna]
Báilame como si fuera la última vez
Y enséñame ese pasito que no sé
Un besito bien suavecito, bebé
Taki taki, taki taki, ¡rumba!

[Intro]
Jatsatsa hilipati-pati labba
Jatsatsa hilipati-pati labba
Jatsatsa hilipati-pati labba
Kariri kariri dip dan din Lan den lan do

[Verso 1: Residente]
Mi flow se les mete a las nenas
Como en la playa cuando se te mete entre las nalgas arena
Un baile con cosas obscenas
Que cuando nos mire la gente, les dé vergüenza ajena
Hasta abajo sin pena
Que se nos olvide que no hemos cobra'o la quincena
Química de la buena, conectado' como las hormiga', pero sin antenas
Mueve ese culei de bomba y plena
Cortaron a Elena, pero nadie nos frena
No somos de Hollywood, pero dominamos la escena
Hasta de espalda la goleamos, una chilena
Hoy nadie nos ordena, sólo este general cuando suena
(Buena, tú te ves bien buena)
Mueve esa vajilla
Como entrando por la puerta de un iglú; doblando rodillas
Como una culebrilla con piernas; resbala zapatillas
Como que el piso esta embarra'o con mantequilla
Azúcar por la vena con jeringuilla
Lo que traigo es chocolate con vainilla
Con mi música tú brillas
En este mundo somos tú y yo y después van las siete maravillas
Pa' los que están senta'os, llegó la pesadilla
Con medio pocillo pongo a perrear hasta a las silla'
Con este dembow les quito el hambre
Se habían olvida'o de que tengo a White Lion en la sangre
Si quieres huevo, caliéntame el nido
Quiero que mis hijos tengan tu apellido
Como inodoro público, un perreo asqueroso
Bien bellacoso, pero sin acoso

[Coro: Residente]
Bien, bien, bien, bien bellacoso
Bien, bien, bien, bien bellacoso
Bien, bien, bien, bien
Bien, bien, bien, bien bellacoso

[Verso 2: Bad Bunny]
Que levante la mano to' el que no fornique
El jevo es medio soso y ella quiere pique
No es interesá', no quiere ticket
Sólo quiere bailar y que no la complique'
Squirt, quiero que me salpique'
Dime dónde quieres que me ubique
""Yo no sé mañana"", dijo Luis Enrique
Por eso no hago pregunta' ni quiero que explique'
Yo voy pa' encimota, baby, estás buenota
Ese chichito ni se nota
Parece un Nokia en el perreo, no se agota
Te vo'a confesar que tú eres mi crush hace rato
No sé si tienes gata o tienes gato
Tranquila, ma', que yo no te delato
Na' de storie', na' de retrato'
Pero si estás seca, yo te hidrato
Bailando tienes un talento innato
Te vi y se me derritió el gelato
Hoy vamo' a romper el cuarto más barato
Porque si toca, toca y hay que darle
'Tá caliente, hay que recetarle
A casa hoy se llega tarde
Que Dios me cuide, pero no me guarde

[Refrán: Residente]
Llegaron los gallos del nido
A darle de comer a las que no han comido
Con un flow fluido
Traemos doble carne con queso, papitas y refresco incluido

[Puente: Bad Bunny]
Hoy la cogemos fea
Hasta que sientas que por la espalda el sudor me chorrea
Me estoy portando mal pa' que me des con la correa
Hoy te enseño cómo se perrea

[Chorus: Ben Gibbard]
Do you remember how when you were younger
The  summers all lasted forever?
Days  disappeared into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever

[Verse 1: Chance the Rapper]
I remember the summer Lil' Chano got ahold of his household
The  same summer that widowed Gwyneth Paltrow
Back  when I could trust in my dogs like Balto
My family The Sopranos, these niggas is altos
First  album, every track could be the outro
Velcro to shelltoes, things that we will outgrow
Used to rock South Pole, summers taking the 6 bus to South Shore
Never sold out but now we out-sold
That  was the summer I learned to love the great outdoors
Learned you get the feds if you can't keep yo' mouth closed
That summer left a couple marks like Groucho
That halo can turn hollow, depending how low
That summer left a couple tan lines
I love my city they let me cut the line on the Dan Ryan
They walk on eggshells and landmines
They communicate with handsigns

[Chorus: Ben Gibbard]
Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Days disappear into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever
Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Days disappear into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
I remember the last summer of the teens
I can't recall too many summers in between
Will Smith, Genie, Donald Glover, Lion King
My daughter on the swing like the 2017 Cubs
My daughter mother double-ringed up
Finger look like jean cuffs, or two lean cups
Used to have obsession with the ""27 Club""
Now I'm turning twenty-seven, wanna make it to the 2070 club
Put the 27's down, Lord, give me a clean lung
Took the ring up out the box, I know this ain't no brief love
This story arc so sharp that it made the streets flood
This the type of covenant you keep love, deep love

[Chorus: Ben Gibbard]
Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Days disappear into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever

Drop is a coupe
Dropping the top of my car (Ayy)
I cannot love on no bitch when she fucking the clique

Hit my bop like I'm Lil Kodak
On the block where it ain't good at
I can't sweat you, I'm like, ""Who that?""
I can't sweat you, I don't do that (Nah, nah, ayy)
Tell you the truth
I ain't want you to depart (Ayy)
I wanted you but I can't fuck with you
'Cause you different, you can't play your part (No, damn, ayy)
Tell you the truth

[Intro: Chance the Rapper]
Yup
And we back (Igh)
Na-na-na (Igh)

[Verse 1: Chance the Rapper]
If you blink you might miss it
You gotta click it or ticket
You gotta go get the gettin' before it's gone
End it quickly as it begun
Life is short as a midget, but mine's a little LeBron
Been a minute since Eminem was a blonde
I need a peace prize‚ mom invented the bomb
A nigga wanted more‚ I would only sit on the lawn
A nigga up next like strongly scented colognes
I'm 'bout to book a show at the Dimmsdale Dimmadome
I still could hit up Sony today and get a loan
And shout out to Miss Sylvia Rhone‚ we get along
But that boy advance gotta be bigger than Diddy Kong
I need stock and it gotta be Pippi Long
Can't stop, won't stop boppin' like Diddy's song
My next tour got eight legs like daddy long
I'm 'bout to have two kids that like daddy's song

[Chorus: John Legend]
We can't be out here pleasin' everybody (Oh, I...)
We know who we are (Oh‚ yeah)
And if you with me, then I'm with you darlin' (Yeah)
Baby, all day long (Come on‚ come on)
Baby, all day long (Oh, I...)
Baby, all day long (Yeah)
Baby, all day long

[Interlude: Chance the Rapper]
This is, this is the day
Took it the scenic route, but this is the way
That's old news, baby, this is today
They gon' miss us today, you a ""Mrs."" today
This is, this is the day
Took it the scenic route, but this is the way
That's old news, baby, this is today
They gon' miss us today, you a ""Mrs."" today

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Backyard blasted, dance 'til it's grassless
Patio glass, the mazel tov cocktails
Bomb, b-bombastic, used to drop acid
Marli come soon, I only drop classics
Everyone ask
""When that heat gon' drop?""
""When that knee gon' drop?""
""When is he gon' pop the question we all got?""
""'Cause this could be y'all block
You're livin' in a glass house, we can see y'all clocks""
But I can see you from the other side, see y'all rocks
And we could've been Magneto, if you seen our locks
But we share it with the world, not just fans
Come out clean lookin' like we jumped the broom and the dustpan
So now it's here and we actin' out
Dame Dash, champagne in the back of Tao
Now I'm back in my bag and the cat is out
Burn a hole in my pocket like a Black & Mild (Igh)

[Chorus: John Legend]
We can't be out here pleasin' everybody (Oh, I...)
I know, you know, we know just who we are (Oh, yeah)
And if you with me, then I'm with you darlin' (Oh, baby)

Baby, all day long (Oh, I...)
Baby, all day long (Yeah)
Baby, all day long (Oh, I...)

[Bridge: John Legend]
Hey, we made it, we made it
I'm feelin' grateful
I'm here with my favorite
Oh God, I'm thankful
Our song and we played it
So good, we played it (Yeah)
I just wanted to keep on playin' (Hey)
We made it, we made it
I'm feelin' grateful

[Intro: Lunay]
Cántame Mau y Ricky
Lu-Lu-Lunay, yeh

[Refrán: Lunay, Mau y Ricky]
Aunque 'taba buscando, yo sigo guardándote a ti el lugar (Lugar)
Y por más que lo intente yo sé que ninguno te va a cambiar (Hmm)
Yo ya casi ni duermo por andar mirando mi celular
Por si acaso a ti se te olvidaba que no me querías llamar (Oh-oh, oh-oh)

[Pre-Coro: Mau y Ricky]
Mi cuerpo te necesita
Mi boca te necesita (Yeh)
¿Por qué no vienes ahorita?

[Coro: Mau y Ricky & Camilo]
Que me muero por besarte la boca, mamá
Hace tiempo que me sueño volverla a probar
Porque bailas como nadie más sabe bailar
Te pareces a la playa y las olas del mar

[Verso 1: Lunay]
(Lunay; yeh-yeh)
Baby, hoy yo te voy a robar pa' hacerte cositas de má'
Prende pa' despejar (-pejar)
Sólo quiero una noche de esas para recordar
Haciéndolo eres vicio, yo no te puedo dejar
Compre pa'l de botella' y ninguna nos bebemo'
Porque no aguantamo' las ganas que nos tenemo'
Ay, baby, tú me miras y ya nos entendemo'
Yo creo que es un pecado como quiera nos comemo'

[Coro: Mau y Ricky, Camilo]
Que me muero por besarte la boca, mamá (Aunque no se me pase el tiempo; yah, yah-yah)
Hace tiempo que me sueño volverla a probar (Yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh; y ahora [?])
Porque bailas como nadie más sabe bailar (Yeh)
Te pareces a la playa y las olas del mar (A la playa, mami, [?])

[Verso 2: Mau y Ricky, Camilo, Lunay]
¡Mau y Ricky!
Si yo no te tengo me muero (No, no)
Tú no estás y me matan los celos
Se me va el aire si tú te vas (No te vayas)
Porque la vida se me va yendo
Baby, sí, yo te quiero para mí (Para mí, para mí)
No te quiero compartir (Oh, no)
Como hielo en el desierto (Como hielo en el desierto)
Yo me derrito por ti (¡Pra!)
Porque cuando tú estás lejos (Cuando tú no estás)
Siento que me pongo viejo (Viejo)
Que no se me pase el tiempo (Pah-pah-pah-pah-eh)

[Coro: Camilo & Lunay]
Que me muero por besarte la boca, mamá (Que me muero, me muero por ti)
Hace tiempo que me sueño volverla a probar (Yeh, yeh, yeh; yo la quiero probar)

[TV Intro: Jimmy Fallon]
Making his TV debut performing ""RNP"" from his upcoming project The Lost Boy with a little help from Anderson .Paak and The Roots, give it up for YBN Cordae!

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak & YBN Cordae, Both]
Come on, New York City, Come on!
One of y'all, y'all, gon' be messin' with me (Oh, what the-, wha-uh, come on)
I got two bad broads gon' be rubbin' my feet (Oh, what the-,  uh, come on)
I got three young shooters down to bust out the heat (Oh, what the-)
And oh, y'all ain't got nothin' on me (Yeah, hey)
Not one of y'all, y'all, gon' be messin' with me
I got two bad misses gon' be rubbin' my feet
I got three young shooters down to bust out the heat
And oh, y'all ain't got nothin' on me

[Verse 1: YBN Cordae]
Uh, ok, put your, uh, hands up, this the, uh, anthem
Smiling 'cause I'm young, rich, black, and I'm handsome
Not to mention wealthy, body on her healthy
Young millionaire, what really can you tell me? Smell me?
Boy, that's Chanel cologne
I'm in Europe with the tourists with no cellular phone
She like-

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak and YBN Cordae]
Ooh, sound like rich brother problems (Uh-huh)
I hit a bad chick with a fistful of condoms
And the randomness, like risky ménages
Hit the head right, she can get what she wanted (Uh-huh)
The spits, then flaunt it, my drip like a faucet
She told me she was prego, I ain't even take the mother, mother ____ out my pocket, yeah

[Verse 3: YBN Cordae]
Hold on, the opposite
She want to fly her, so I copped a jet
Must be thinkin' I'm a one-way ticket on a runway
Drippin' in my feng shui, sippin' on a sundae

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak & YBN Cordae, Both]
One of y'all, y'all, gon' be messin' with me (Mmm)
I got two bad broads gon' be rubbin' my feet (Oh, what the-,  uh, come on)
I got three young shooters down to bust out the heat (Oh, what)
And oh, y'all ain't got nothin' on me (Hey)
Not one of y'all, y'all, gon' be messin' with me
I got two bad misses gon' be rubbin' my feet (Come one)
I got three young shooters down to bust out the heat
And oh, y'all ain't got nothin' on me

[Verse 4: YBN Cordae & Anderson .Paak]
Listen, I bought a Moncler coat for the times we were broke
I'ma wear it in the summer on LeBron James boat
Front row? Duh, bro, we don't sit on nosebleeds
Ain't your pockets obese? They won't fit in those seats
Ayy, we like a cold team, bro, Shaq and Kobe
Like back in '03, I was only like 6
I was like 16, but, I can give a sixteen
I can make a chick scream, that's a bit extreme
I got a thick bald chick, I call her Ms. Clean (Uh-huh)
My drip frosty like Halls and Listerine (Uh-huh)
We all all-stars, you hardly sixth string
Yeah, I had to ball hard to harvest these dreams
Swear to God, me too, no Harvey Weinstein
The coupe was lime green, my wrist was blinding
Prolly in New York, Ferraris and blue cheese
Bro, does that even mean? Just let the hook sing (Come on)

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak & YBN Cordae, Both]
One of y'all, y'all, gon' be messin' with me (Oh, what the-, wha-uh, come on)
I got two bad broads gon' be rubbin' my feet (Oh, what the-,  uh, come on)
I got three young shooters down to bust out the heat

[TV Intro: Jimmy Fallon]
Making his TV debut performing ""RNP"" from his upcoming project The Lost Boy with a little help from Anderson .Paak and The Roots, give it up for YBN Cordae!

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak & YBN Cordae, Both]
Come on, New York City, Come on!
One of y'all, y'all, gon' be messin' with me (Oh, what the-, wha-uh, come on)
I got two bad broads gon' be rubbin' my feet (Oh, what the-,  uh, come on)
I got three young shooters down to bust out the heat (Oh, what the-)
And oh, y'all ain't got nothin' on me (Yeah, hey)
Not one of y'all, y'all, gon' be messin' with me
I got two bad misses gon' be rubbin' my feet
I got three young shooters down to bust out the heat
And oh, y'all ain't got nothin' on me

[Verse 1: YBN Cordae]
Uh, ok, put your, uh, hands up, this the, uh, anthem
Smiling 'cause I'm young, rich, black, and I'm handsome
Not to mention wealthy, body on her healthy
Young millionaire, what really can you tell me? Smell me?
Boy, that's Chanel cologne
I'm in Europe with the tourists with no cellular phone
She like-

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak and YBN Cordae]
Ooh, sound like rich brother problems (Uh-huh)
I hit a bad chick with a fistful of condoms
And the randomness, like risky ménages
Hit the head right, she can get what she wanted (Uh-huh)
The spits, then flaunt it, my drip like a faucet
She told me she was prego, I ain't even take the mother, mother ____ out my pocket, yeah

[Verse 3: YBN Cordae]
Hold on, the opposite
She want to fly her, so I copped a jet
Must be thinkin' I'm a one-way ticket on a runway
Drippin' in my feng shui, sippin' on a sundae

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak & YBN Cordae, Both]
One of y'all, y'all, gon' be messin' with me (Mmm)
I got two bad broads gon' be rubbin' my feet (Oh, what the-,  uh, come on)
I got three young shooters down to bust out the heat (Oh, what)
And oh, y'all ain't got nothin' on me (Hey)
Not one of y'all, y'all, gon' be messin' with me
I got two bad misses gon' be rubbin' my feet (Come one)
I got three young shooters down to bust out the heat
And oh, y'all ain't got nothin' on me

[Verse 4: YBN Cordae & Anderson .Paak]
Listen, I bought a Moncler coat for the times we were broke
I'ma wear it in the summer on LeBron James boat
Front row? Duh, bro, we don't sit on nosebleeds
Ain't your pockets obese? They won't fit in those seats
Ayy, we like a cold team, bro, Shaq and Kobe
Like back in '03, I was only like 6
I was like 16, but, I can give a sixteen
I can make a chick scream, that's a bit extreme
I got a thick bald chick, I call her Ms. Clean (Uh-huh)
My drip frosty like Halls and Listerine (Uh-huh)
We all all-stars, you hardly sixth string
Yeah, I had to ball hard to harvest these dreams
Swear to God, me too, no Harvey Weinstein
The coupe was lime green, my wrist was blinding
Prolly in New York, Ferraris and blue cheese
Bro, does that even mean? Just let the hook sing (Come on)

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak & YBN Cordae, Both]
One of y'all, y'all, gon' be messin' with me (Oh, what the-, wha-uh, come on)
I got two bad broads gon' be rubbin' my feet (Oh, what the-,  uh, come on)
I got three young shooters down to bust out the heat
And oh, y'all ain't got nothin' on me (Hey)
Not one of y'all, y'all, gon' be messin' with me (Come on)
I got two bad misses gon' be rubbin' my feet (Come on)
I got three young shooters down to bust out the heat
And oh, y'all ain't got nothin' on me

What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawin' me in and you kickin' me out
You've got my head spinnin', no kiddin'
I can't pin you down
What's goin' on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright

[Pre-Chorus]
My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[Chorus]
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you

Give your all to me

I can't stop singing, it's ringing
In my head for you

You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

And you give me all of you, oh-oh

How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I'm around
Through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing
In my head for you

[Pre-Chorus]
My head's under water, but I'm breathin' fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

Risking it all, though it's hard

Give your all to me

Drawin' me in and you kickin' me out
You've got my head spinnin', no kiddin'

I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me

Well, you done done me, and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
And now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention

To win some or learn some

(Contigo perreando; Ozuna; ¡fuimo'!)

[Coro: Anuel AA, Daddy Yankee & Ozuna]
Mi mujer me estaba llamando
Pero yo no contesté (Uah, baby; sube)
Porque yo estaba contigo perreando
Y de ella me olvidé (Mami)
Dios mío, perdóname
No sé por qué yo le fallé (Fallé; uah)
Yo estaba en la disco perreando
Y con ella me enredé (Woh, oh, oh; ¡fuego!; uah)

De la forma en que me miraba (Woh, oh, oh)
Podía notar que ella tenía lo que en la disco buscaba (Buscaba)
Quería que me bailara (Woh, oh)
Y el DJ que la música nunca me la bajara
Y se está prendí'a en fuego (Fuego)
Que no se enamora, ella está pa'l juego (Pa'l juego)
Anda sola, nunca le baja a su ego (A su ego)
Me provoca y facilito me le pego (Me le pego)
Y es que se está prendí'a en fuego (En fuego)

Me provoca y facilito me le pego y es que (Jaja)

[Verso 2: Anuel AA, Ozuna & Daddy Yankee]

Baby, pon la mano en el suelo (Suelo)
Y juégate con el pelo (El pelo)
Tu cuerpo es puro veneno (Veneno)
Bebé, tú me lleva' al cielo (Baby; ¡duro!)

I know my enemy prey on me, so pray for me
Tick, tick, wait on it
I'm keepin' down my body count
I'm finessin' like a trap bounce, a trap bounce, yeah
'Cause every day above ground is a blessing
I done leveled up now, view panoramic
None of my fears can't go where I'm headed
Had to cut 'em loose, now I'm loose, break the levy, yeah
I'm 'bout to flood on 'the roof, flood on the ceiling
The rain and thunder gon' fall, go Mutumbo, no, no center
You can't dim my light

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
'Cause when we walk up in the club
I need them sirens goin' off
Then we can look up in the sky
The tears we cry let us know that we alive, yeah, yeah
It give me goosebumps every time
I threw up my diamond
Together we're big timin'
Don't make me have to remind ya

That's the sound of the price goin' up

Bumpin' Fela on the Puma jet, like we from Lagos (My daughter)
Mansa Musa reincarnated, we on our levels (He 'bout business)
That's a billi', a thousand milli'
First one to see a B out these housing buildings
I be feelin' like Prince in '84 (Ow)
Mike in '79, Biggie in '97, '94 Nas
Ali bomaye, no kumbaya
Just give me the Sommelier (I got it), I'm on La Tâche
Helmet, on a jetski, you know the vibes
Hit my head, forget I'm me (I love it), oh my God
Without the God in the XY (Yeah, yeah)
I'm afraid the whole game would be colonized (Yeah, yeah)
The marathon will be televised for N.I.P.​
'Cause true kings don't die, we multiply, peace

[Verse 3: Beyoncé]
I'm so unbothered, I'm so unbothered
Y'all be so pressed while I'm raisin' daughters
Sons of empires, y'all make me chuckle
Stay in your struggle, crystal blue water
Piña colada-in', you stay Ramada Inn
My baby father, bloodline Rwanda
Why would you try me? Why would you bother?
I am Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter
I am the Nala, sister of Naruba
Osun, Queen Sheba, I am the mother
Ankh on my gold chain, ice on my whole chain
I be like soul food, I am a whole mood

When we walk up in the club
I need them sirens goin' off
Then we can look up to the sky
The tears we cry let us know that we alive, yeah, yeah

The children are our reminder

Forever and ever
Ever, forever
Forever and ever
Ever and ever and ever
Time to break it down now

[Bridge: Childish Gambino]
All praise to
My enemies still praise
Get along
'Cause I've bet on myself
I'm dancin'
Ancestors in my step
Now I move better, ooh
And I live on, on
I feel a change goin' on
Royalty in my blood, run the kingdom
The more money, more problem season
But don't nothin' get you out your way
Rise up higher
Jump, jump and don't look down
You're so far from the ground
You're way...

I got my cup up to the heavens
Another night I won't remember
Promise this my mood forever
Promise this my mood forever-ever

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I know my enemy prey on me, so pray for me
Tick, tick, wait on it
I'm keepin' down my body count
I'm finessin' like a trap bounce, a trap bounce, yeah
'Cause every day above ground is a blessing
I done leveled up now, view panoramic
None of my fears can't go where I'm headed
Had to cut 'em loose, now I'm loose, break the levy, yeah
I'm 'bout to flood on 'the roof, flood on the ceiling
The rain and thunder gon' fall, go Mutumbo, no, no center
You can't dim my light

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
'Cause when we walk up in the club
I need them sirens goin' off
Then we can look up in the sky
The tears we cry let us know that we alive, yeah, yeah
It give me goosebumps every time
I threw up my diamond
Together we're big timin'
Don't make me have to remind ya

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
I got my cup up to the heavens
Another night I won't remember
Promise this my mood forever
Promise this my mood forever, ever
Dancers dancin' on the bezel
This kinda feelin' unforgettable
Promise this my mood forever
Promise this my mood forever

[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé & JAY-Z]
Forever and ever
You heard that?
Forever and ever
That's the sound of the price goin' up

[Verse 2: JAY-Z & Beyoncé]
Forever, and ever-ever, and ever-ever (Yeah, yeah)
At the Saxon Madiba suite, like Mandela (Yeah, yeah)
Bumpin' Fela on the Puma jet, like we from Lagos (My daughter)
Mansa Musa reincarnated, we on our levels (He 'bout business)
That's a billi', a thousand milli'
First one to see a B out these housing buildings
I be feelin' like Prince in '84 (Ow)
Mike in '79, Biggie in '97, '94 Nas
Ali bomaye, no kumbaya
Just give me the Sommelier (I got it), I'm on La Tâche
Helmet, on a jetski, you know the vibes
Hit my head, forget I'm me (I love it), oh my God
Without the God in the XY (Yeah, yeah)
I'm afraid the whole game would be colonized (Yeah, yeah)
The marathon will be televised for N.I.P.​
'Cause true kings don't die, we multiply, peace

[Verse 3: Beyoncé]
I'm so unbothered, I'm so unbothered
Y'all be so pressed while I'm raisin' daughters
Sons of empires, y'all make me chuckle
Stay in your struggle, crystal blue water
Piña colada-in', you stay Ramada Inn
My baby father, bloodline Rwanda
Why would you try me? Why would you bother?
I am Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter
I am the Nala, sister of Naruba
Osun, Queen Sheba, I am the mother
Ankh on my gold chain, ice on my whole chain
I be like soul food, I am a whole mood

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
When we walk up in the club
I need them sirens goin' off
Then we can look up to the sky
The tears we cry let us know that we alive, yeah, yeah
I give 'em goosebumps every time
I threw up my diamond
Together we're big timin'
The children are our reminder

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
I got my cup up to the heavens
Another night I won't remember
Promise this my mood forever
Promise this my mood forever-ever
Treasures dancin' on the bezel
This kinda feelin' unforgettable
Promise this my mood forever
Promise this my mood forever

[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Forever and ever
Ever, forever
Forever and ever
Ever and ever and ever
Time to break it down now

[Bridge: Childish Gambino]
All praise to
My enemies still praise
Get along
'Cause I've bet on myself
I'm dancin'
Ancestors in my step
Now I move better, ooh
And I live on, on
I feel a change goin' on
Royalty in my blood, run the kingdom
The more money, more problem season
But don't nothin' get you out your way
Rise up higher
Jump, jump and don't look down
You're so far from the ground
You're way...

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
I got my cup up to the heavens
Another night I won't remember
Promise this my mood forever
Promise this my mood forever-ever
Dancers dancin' on the bezel
This kinda feelin' unforgettable
Promise this my mood forever
Promise this my mood forever
Forever and ever

Look

[Verse 1]
Touchin' you slowly, love how you hold me
I was a player, that was the old me
I sent a prayer for something holy
Got naked and show me
Girl, summer's been lonely, yeah
At first, I was hesitant
(Spooky) Like a skeleton
You 20, but intelligent
Now all them other bitches so irrelevant, ah-ah, yeah
Tan lines and some memories (Woo)
Guess summer got the best of me (Woo)
Chef B with the recipe, yeah
With you, it's a better me

I guess what I'm sayin' is, I
I fuckin' love you
I guess what I'm sayin', I guess what I'm sayin'

Yes, I do, chillin' top floor with a penthouse view
But that don't mean a thing unless I'm next to you
'Cause money just money 'less I spend it on you
Next to me, when I'm with you, you bring out the best of me
God made you a twin, but you the one I see
But shoutout to Elisha, that's my baby (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
But if I wrote you a love song, would you sing it?
If I needed bail out of jail, would you bring it?
If I win, then we're up, if we fail, then we wing it

[Chorus]
I guess what I'm sayin', I guess what I'm sayin'
I guess what I'm sayin' is, I

Wheezy outta here

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Yeah, rest in peace to Bankroll‚ show 'em how to do it
Baby goin' crazy‚ he been gettin' straight to it
I done caught so many flights I end up fuckin' all the stewardesses
Catch me in Atlanta‚ no security with my jewelry
Found I was rich, my baby mama talkin' suin' me
'Nother bitch tellin' lies on the pussy like she screwin' me
Catch him down bad, that's his ass‚ nigga, you or me
SI diamonds on the chain, he ain't foolin' me
We was skippin' school on the train‚ duckin' truancy
My main partner turned into a rat, he talkin' 'bout robbin' me
I pray the judge give that boy a bond so I can pop him
We was in the hood, sellin' bags, shootin' choppers
Fucked around and tried to go and lease a helicopter
Baby really a problem, somebody gotta stop him
And the haters watchin' too hard, I think they got binoculars
Every nigga with me on go, it ain't no stoppin' us
Niggas actin' like they got the bag, I'm tryna stop it up
Do this for the bros down the road, gotta lock it up
All you gotta do is say it's smoke, then we're poppin' up
Baby got the streets on hold, he ain't drop yet
I've been goin' hard, it's gon' be hard for you to top that
I make it look easy, but this shit really a process
I'm really a millionaire, still in the projects

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Baby puttin' on for the city
Baby, he the realest, Baby prolly got a couple million
Baby hang with four or five killers
Baby got children, Baby prolly still drug dealin
Baby ain't a trapper, he a rapper
Baby makin' classics, Baby in the hood gettin' active
Baby keep it real with his people
Baby like a preacher, Baby prolly still sell reefer

[Verse 2: DaBaby]
Huh? Baby prolly still got them 'bows
I tell my bitch I'm faithful, but I still got the hoes
Baby gettin' jiggy, on stage with the Glizzy
Baby CEO, he shake the game like he Diddy
You would think it's Mardi Gras, I got these bitches showin' titties
And I ain't throwin' beads, I pull them bitches' weaves
I'm stallin' bitches out, if I'm a dog, then she a flea
And when I fuck her doggystyle the only time I'm on my knee
I barely wanna hit her, got her beggin', ""Baby, please""
I tell a bitch to shut up, you 'bout to fuck my nut up
The label's CEO keep beggin' me to keep the gun up
They know, you play with Baby, Baby beat him, cut up
Private plane, Wi-Fi, on the FaceTime with Johnny
I told him ice my wrist up, I like to hold my fist up
How that boy DaBaby in the air not gettin' his dick sucked?
Why he keep the fire and throw them fours in every picture?
'Cause nigga...

Sabah yaptım krep, krep
Ne güzel oldu breh, breh
Sardım yedim wrap, wrap
Kafam düştü direk, direk
Her yer olsa da kezban, tırrek
Yatamam evde yatak döşek
Çıktım dışarı, açtım Trap
Kafam şimdi, fişek, fişek
Oh, yeah, geceler
Cihangirli heceler
Elit, foşik turistler
Sokaklar ve polisler
Viski döküp sevişelim

Dedim: ""Tamam hadi canim.""

Ama beni Hitler gibi kariyerimle tehdit eder Pozitif'ten Elif Cemal
Ben boyun eğmem soyunu diss'lerim
Çıldırtırım etnik faşistleri
Umrumda değil kuliste otlayan sürekli koklayan zifoslar
Ve beni dinler devrimci gençler sizi yavşak lümpen Migos'lar

O zaman güçlü zayıfı ezecek
Size yok sosis, salam, şırdan şırdan

[Letra de ""Rebota"" (Remix) ft. Becky G & Sech]

[Intro: Sech, Guaynaa & DJ Luian]
(This is the remix)
Mamarre, mamarre, mamarre, mamarre
Cuando va pa' la disco, ella queda encendí'a
Llega con to'a las amigas
Ella baja downtown, si te pichea, estás out
Mientras rebota, ella dice que esa no
DJ, que le ponga una de Don (Que le ponga una de Don)
A ella le gusta el reggaetón-tón-tón-tón-tón
Que está suelta y que dejen la presión
¡Guaynaa!; ¡this is the remix!

[Coro: Guaynaa]
Cómo lo mueve esa muchachota
Metiéndole al dembow es que se bota
Y yo postia'o aquí con esta nota
La miro y rebotan, rebotan, rebotan, rebota
Cómo lo mueve esa muchachita
Le mete al dembow y no se quita
Yo tengo el ritmo que la debilita
Ella tiene nalga y tetita, nalga y tetita

[Verso 1: Farruko & DJ Luian]
(¡Farruko!)
El ambiente esta como pa' prende' un blunt (¡Blep!)
Camino a Palomino, voy bajando 'e Bayamón (Jajaja)
Las baby' en bikini, el bote con el musicón (¡Blep!)
Hoy vamo' a gangalear, ponle dembow con reggaetón (Po-po-po)
E' que este e' un party de gangster, de lo' maliante' (Yah-yah-yah)
Pa', vete, cabrón, si en verdá', tú no la hace' (¡Blep!)
Y to'a las babys y to' los tigers
Y que esto no pare, no pare, no pare (¡Farru!; jajaja)
Tropicalito con Coronita y limón (Wuh)
Empecé suavecito y terminé con el Patrón (Wuh)
El Guaynaa me grita: ""¡Diablo, Farru, 'tás cabrón!""
Y yo aquí con una nota, guayando a tremendo bizcochón

[Puente: Farruko]
Y ven suéltate conmigo, mamá (Tra)
Que yo me vo'a soltar, ven (Tra)
Yo soy que te aloco, mamá (Pum-pum)
Ven, dame lo que quiero y mama

[Verso 2: Becky G & DJ Luian]
(¡Becky G!)
Yo tengo to' lo que un hombre necesita (Mhm)
No te confunda' si me ve' calladita (Na')
Por fuera sana, por dentro diablita
Chiquita con las pompis paradita' (¡Trr!)
Apaga los celulare', aquí no quiero foto'
Pa' que-Pa' que este perreo se quede entre nosotros
Y dime si tú aguanta' presión, perréame sin condición
Y dime si tú aguanta' presión, perreame pa' que vea' cómo rebota

[Coro: Guaynaa]
Cómo lo mueve esa muchachota
Metiéndole al dembow es que se bota
Y yo postia'o aquí con esta nota
La miro y rebotan, rebotan, rebotan, rebota
Cómo lo mueve esa muchachita
Le mete al dembow y no se quita
Yo tengo el ritmo que la debilita
Ella tiene nalga y tetita, nalga y tetita

[Verso 3: Guaynaa]
Tú ya tienes 18, entonce' estás en ley
Quiero acampar en tus montañas de Cayey
¿Que librastes a los 16? (Wow), okay
Andamos en el dembow con el fucking Charlie Way, ey
Bájale, mami, como 7 mil quiniento'
Me tienes en estado de aborrecimiento
Si tú me das un brake yo te voy a hacer un cuento
¿Quieres conocer a Junito? Yo te lo presento (Ma-)
Marrayo parta, qué presión cómo se le marca el pantalón
De la camisa le explota el botón
Y pa'l cielo no hay Uber, pero me tienes pidiendo pon

[Verso 4: Nicky Jam, Guaynaa & DJ Luian]
(¡Nicky Jam!)
Hija 'el diablo, Dios te reprenda
Por ti vendo la casa, los carro' y hasta las prenda'
¿No te han dicho ""Nicky en la cama es una leyenda""?
Pero tú también tienes carita de tremenda
Ah, pero tú ere' una jodienda
Ella pide má' y eso le daré
Yo la voy a castigar, no perdonaré (Duro)
No, yo no pararé, mami, to' la noche te vo'a dar
Por-Por eso tú me activa', porque baila' como e'
Tu' pecho' y tu nalga, eso rebota como e'
No sé lo que tú tiene' que lo pone' como e'
Pe-Pero si me tira 'e noche, rápido te llegaré

[Skit: Guaynaa]
¿Mera, pero van a seguir apretando?
Si ustede' quieren, yo me bajo 'el tema

Just a small town girl
Living in a lonely world
She took the midnight train
Going anywhere
Just a city boy
Born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train
Going anywhere

[Guitar riff]

[Verse 2]
A singer in a smoky room
A smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

[Chorus 1]
Strangers waiting
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlights, people
Living just to find emotion
Hiding somewhere in the night

[Verse 3]
Working hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time
Some will win, some will lose
Some were born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on

[Chorus 1]
Strangers waiting
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlights, people
Living just to find emotion
Hiding somewhere in the night

'Cause it's about to happen

When I touch down, keep it on the low-low (It's lit!)
I don't mess with your energy (Nah), no photos (Ayy)
So antisocial, but I don't care (Ayy)
Don't give a damn, I'm gonna smoke here (Ayy, pop it)
Got a bottle in my hand, bring more though (Ayy, pop it, pop it)
Got my hat low, don't talk to me (Straight up!)

Where you standin' way too close
You might catch fumes, might catch fumes
When I zoom (Pew), when I zoom
Pass out, wake up by myself right past noon
Right past noon, then I'm doomed
Occupied and movin' dolo (Ooh, yeah)
Hennessy's drownin' all of my issues (Drown)
Right before I leave, she give me more than just a ""miss you"" (Yeah)
That thing got more back, just like my engine, I can hit it
(In the boy) Seen a vision in the boy, then we committed (It's lit!)

[1er couplet: Ed Sheeran]
Ouais, je suis né marginal
Grandi  à 16km de la ville de Ipswich
Voulu  la rendre plus grande, souhaité de l'existence
Je n'ai jamais été un gosse déjanté, toujours vite ignorer
Reste au chant, arrête de rapper comme si c'est Noel
Et  si tu parles d'argent, alors ma conversation change
Mes  rêves sont plus grands qu'être simplement sur la liste des plus riches
Pourrait être la folie, mais les gens appellent ça "" doué ""
Ma  face s'engourdit par ce qu'il y a dans cette merde
Regarde comment les paroles des musiques peuvent être déformées
Ma femme porte du rouge, mais reste plus belle sans rouge à lèvre
J'suis un mec secret et tu ne connais rien de mes affaires
Et  si j'avais mes 15minutes, j'ai du les louper
A 20 ans c'est quand je suis arrivé dans le game
Et maintenant ca fait 8 ans et tu te souviens du nom
Et si tu pensais que j'étais bon, alors j'suis meilleur aujourd'hui
Mais c'est ironique comment vous pensiez tous que je n'aurais jamais été bon
J'aime mes concert en plein air, de Tokyo au Delaware
Levez vos tel en l'air si vous voulez être bercé
Vous savez que je veux bien plus que je n'ai déjà
Donnez moi un son avec Eminem et 50 Cent dans le club

(Ed Sheeran, 50Cent: REFRAIN )
Tu sais que c'est pas mon heure pour m'arrêter là
Je veux reprendre et être payé
Mais c'est à partir du moment tu te souviens du nom
Ayy, Ayy
Tu sais que c'est pas mon heure pour m'arrêter là
Je veux reprendre et être payé
Mais c'est à partir du moment tu te souviens du nom
Ayy, Ayy



[2éme couplet: Eminem]
Je me rappelle toujours ( Quoi ? ) d'essayer d'avoir un contrat ( Uh uuh )
De Taco Bell à TRL
J'ai grimpé les charts du Billboards jusqu'au sommet
Comme le destin le voulait ( Yeah ), devenu un accroc
Marrant parce que j'ai eu recours à la pop
Mais ils ont dit le temps nous dira ( Quoi ? ) si j'aurais régner ( huh ? )
Et tout ce que j'ai fait c'était ( Quoi ? ) enfoncer 22cm d'ongles ( où?)
Dans mes paupières maintenant ( quoi ? )
Je vois des ventes de diamant comme si j'étais dans Zales ( Yeah )
Sans aucun doute, par tout les moyens
Si le rap était un jean serré, je pourrais rien faire dedans
J'écarterai les coutures du jean quand je déballerai mes schémas
Lequel veut vraiment dire, pas de ""si"", de ""et"" ou ""mais"" sont serrés dedans
Tu t'endors sur moi parce que tu baises seulement avec moi dans tes rêves
Pas même quand je suis sur mon lit de mort
Mec, j'ressens comme Ed, ce n'est pas encore l'heure de déposer le mic
Donc pourquoi devrais-je arrêter ?
La pensée que je devrais arrêter quand j'suis mort
Vient juste de me traverser l'esprit
Je l'ai dit, puis j'ai oublié ce que j'ai dit



[Eminem, Ed Sheeran: REFRAIN]
Tu sais que c'est pas mon heure pour m'arrêter là
J'suis enfermé dans le rap et j'suis déjà payé
Mais c'est à partir du moment tu te souviens du nom
Ayy, Ayy
Tu sais que c'est pas mon heure pour m'arrêter là
J'suis enfermé dans le rap et j'suis déjà payé
Mais c'est à partir du moment tu te souviens du nom
Ayy, Ayy




[3éme couplet: 50Cent]
Personne n'est aussi froid que moi, Jm'habille trop frais, trop propre
Tu peux me trouver dans ma voiture de luxe, portant du Fendi
Mec, tu vois ce que je veux dire

Partout où je pose ma voix, cette merde perce, n'est-ce pas ?
Saga Balenciaga, Jsuis dans Bergdorf entrain crâner
C'est juste un autre episode, mes michto, je les spoile
Elle aime ce qui vole et j'aime acheter n'importe quoi
Merde, j'ai de l'argent bêtement, qu'est-ce que je peux faire d'autre avec cet oseille
Salope, On va aller crâner dehors, le roi te rapporte 50 bouteilles
Ce soir, on va faire péter le chequier, pense au conséquence demain
La soirée va être dingue, on va être super chaud
Mec, j'balance de vrais faits, c'est juste comment on ambiance ça
Demain, on va se reposer jusqu'à qu'on soit sobre
Puis c'est l'heure de recommencer, et ça repart encore !

[1er couplet: Ed Sheeran]
Ouais, je suis né marginal
Grandi  à 16km de la ville de Ipswich
Voulu  la rendre plus grande, souhaité de l'existence
Je n'ai jamais été un gosse déjanté, toujours vite ignorer
Reste au chant, arrête de rapper comme si c'est Noel
Et  si tu parles d'argent, alors ma conversation change
Mes  rêves sont plus grands qu'être simplement sur la liste des plus riches
Pourrait être la folie, mais les gens appellent ça "" doué ""
Ma  face s'engourdit par ce qu'il y a dans cette merde
Regarde comment les paroles des musiques peuvent être déformées
Ma femme porte du rouge, mais reste plus belle sans rouge à lèvre
J'suis un mec secret et tu ne connais rien de mes affaires
Et  si j'avais mes 15minutes, j'ai du les louper
A 20 ans c'est quand je suis arrivé dans le game
Et maintenant ca fait 8 ans et tu te souviens du nom
Et si tu pensais que j'étais bon, alors j'suis meilleur aujourd'hui
Mais c'est ironique comment vous pensiez tous que je n'aurais jamais été bon
J'aime mes concert en plein air, de Tokyo au Delaware
Levez vos tel en l'air si vous voulez être bercé
Vous savez que je veux bien plus que je n'ai déjà
Donnez moi un son avec Eminem et 50 Cent dans le club

(Ed Sheeran, 50Cent: REFRAIN )
Tu sais que c'est pas mon heure pour m'arrêter là
Je veux reprendre et être payé
Mais c'est à partir du moment tu te souviens du nom

Mais c'est à partir du moment tu te souviens du nom

[2éme couplet: Eminem]
Je me rappelle toujours ( Quoi ? ) d'essayer d'avoir un contrat ( Uh uuh )
De Taco Bell à TRL
J'ai grimpé les charts du Billboards jusqu'au sommet
Comme le destin le voulait ( Yeah ), devenu un accroc
Marrant parce que j'ai eu recours à la pop
Mais ils ont dit le temps nous dira ( Quoi ? ) si j'aurais régner ( huh ? )
Et tout ce que j'ai fait c'était ( Quoi ? ) enfoncer 22cm d'ongles ( où?)
Dans mes paupières maintenant ( quoi ? )
Je vois des ventes de diamant comme si j'étais dans Zales ( Yeah )
Sans aucun doute, par tout les moyens
Si le rap était un jean serré, je pourrais rien faire dedans
J'écarterai les coutures du jean quand je déballerai mes schémas
Lequel veut vraiment dire, pas de ""si"", de ""et"" ou ""mais"" sont serrés dedans
Tu t'endors sur moi parce que tu baises seulement avec moi dans tes rêves
Pas même quand je suis sur mon lit de mort
Mec, j'ressens comme Ed, ce n'est pas encore l'heure de déposer le mic
Donc pourquoi devrais-je arrêter ?
La pensée que je devrais arrêter quand j'suis mort
Vient juste de me traverser l'esprit
Je l'ai dit, puis j'ai oublié ce que j'ai dit

I feel it, can you feel it tonight?
I feel the fire between you and I
I mean it, don't you turn off the light
Though I don't wanna leave you ever, no
She was like ""Damn¨
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand
So don't make plans
For nothing but me and a lil' romance,"" hey
You and I, whiskey on ice
Maybe later we can turn down all the lights
So keep 'em on with nothing on
Ooh-my-my-my

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Paulo Londra]
I was rolling up something with you
Kickin' back in a way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone (Prr)
But they ain't got nothing on you (Ah, ah)
And you ain't got nothing on you (Leones Con Flow)

Ahora tengo tu olor, ven a la habitación
Lo que hacemo' lo' do' no se puede igualar
Parecemo' ficción cuando entramo' en acción

Look, take the lead, follow me, what's it gonna be?
How you playin' hard to get when you hollered me?
I take Chanel to Chanel for a shopping spree
Home girl, only right she in a proper tee
What I want and need, you and a sofa
I fly in a spaceship, I gotta land the Rover
Casa Cruz, Casa Blanca, Casanova
I'm a fashionista, she in Fashion Nova
And a mad persona when I had her over
The outfit, it cost bread, I got the matching loafers
Why? 'Cause that's suttin' to do
I got a million and two but they're nothin' on you, nah

Gotta trust your crowd, gotta land in the cloud, babe
Baby, I got that feel (Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo)
I don't know why you're doin' this to me
I tried to tell 'em not to do it this loud
I tried to tell 'em not to bust it out the wrap' 'til we leave
I was thinkin' suicide for the rivals
I done went and bought a car with the title
Told the promoters have her on the rider
Knockin' boots backstage at the Wireless
She contagious like poison ivy

This love give you protein and vitamin (Yeah)

[Intro: Young Thug]
Ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing
You done knocked me right off of my feet

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Young Thug]
Baby, I got the feels, yeah
Say that I'm out my mind, but it's somethin' real
Somethin' real
Ooh, I got the feels, yeah (Ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing)
I waited most my life for somethin' real (You done knocked me right off of my feet)
Baby, I got the feels for ya
Baby, I got the feels for ya

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Jump into the crowd, leave your hand in the sky, babe
No hand, no nothin'
Gotta trust your crowd, gotta land in the cloud, babe
Baby, I got that feel (Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo)
I don't know why you're doin' this to me
I tried to tell 'em not to do it this loud
I tried to tell 'em not to bust it out the wrap' 'til we leave
I was thinkin' suicide for the rivals
I done went and bought a car with the title
Told the promoters have her on the rider
Knockin' boots backstage at the Wireless
She contagious like poison ivy

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Young Thug]
Baby, I got the feels, yeah
Say that I'm out my mind, but it's somethin' real
Somethin' real
Ooh, I got the feels, yeah (Ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing)
I waited most my life for somethin' real
(You done knocked me right off of my feet)
Baby, I got the feels for ya
Baby, I got the feels for ya

[Verse 2: J Hus]
Used to be Playboy heartbreaker
But for you, I'll travel a thousand acres
When we met, I told her I play for Lakers (Alright)
One day, we'll get married in Las Vegas (Nah)
I'm good for your health, this can't be a sin (Alright)
This love give you protein and vitamin (Yeah)
See you wigglin', jigglin' (Mmm)
If I have a bite, will it taste like cinnamon? (One)
This is one in a million
So I never ever treat you like Billie Jean
Ain't nothin' like anything I ever really seen
And you give me this feel if you know what I mean

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Young Thug]
Baby, I got the feels, yeah (Ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing
You done knocked me right off of my feet)

Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
This the type of shit we used to dream of (Yeah, yeah)
Bad bitch look like Mona Lisa (Mona Lisa)
Flippin' off a yacht in Ibiza (Splash, water)
Clear port, hasta la vista
Do it all again when we touchdown, everything bust down
Teacher said I would lose, I be like, ""What now?""
I started makin' moves, they showin' me love now
Lit like a light bulb 'cause, bitch, I'm the plug now
And now you know we poppin', we bubble like soda poppin'
I see it, I like it, I wake up, pull up, and go and cop it
The millions get wired, them Benny hunnids still go in pocket
I party with Ed Sheeran, my homies still hold a rocket
'Cause I'm so hood, it don't make no sense
Still remember the times I couldn't pay my rent
Now, I walk in a stadiums, tell 'em, ""Play my shit""
And they gon' sing like this

Last night, I played a show at a stadium in Atlanta
Husband and wives, daddies and daughters with the cameras
I never thought it would get this big, but why does it matter?
Everything is already part of a plan
I remember, damn, me and my man inside of this Splitter van
200 a night, end of 2010
Stayin' up in every city's Holiday Inn
If it wasn't there, then I was at the couch of a friend's
Wetherspoon's was an easy option to get a cheaper lunch and
£2 pint, the waitress maybe leave her number
On to the next town, but now it's to the next continent (Woo)
And I don't think it's gonna be stoppin' anytime soon
Birds eye view, pay my dues for a two-mile queue
Don't need to read reviews if you can't do the things I do
Oh, let me invite you to my world

I don't even know how much I made this year
I'm so used to bein' on some player shit
Cheated on my girlfriend with a famous bitch
Hoodie on pull up, just like the Reaper, yeah
I do this on the regular, make you seem unfair
St. Laurent, Gucci sweater, the red and green Moncler
Me and Meek and Ed Sheeran just like the Beatles, yeah
From her head to her toe, she know she be flee, oh yeah
Everyday, I be seein' her and Ceiline, oh yeah
She wanna come closer, but I don't see us there
I'm not a regular person, I be low-key, oh yeah
From New York out to London
She was, she was with me all the time
And I've been on the road, so long she couldn't call my line
And now she got her ass and titties done for a thousand likes

Not just the when I'm in your bed on my back times
Baby, every time I call, it's a bad time
Just want you here on your own""

There ain't no diamonds, silver or gold
That can replace a man's love in the home
And she keeps tellin' me over and over

You know I just want your time

I used to be around more, but I was strapped for cash
And that's not attractive, workin' my ass off
Tryna make a success outta myself I guess
I could have been more present, but I was in a mess
I remember bein' on tour, stayin' up on the phone
30 minute conversation, ""Boy, when you comin' home?
I can't be buildin' a family life here on my own""
Baby, I'm doin' it for us, so why you takin' that tone?
Like I'm the bad guy
I thought it would have made me better in your dad's eyes
I'm busy stackin' up the paper for the bad times
'Cause, baby, you never know
I'm poppin right now, but there will come a day when I won't

And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistaken?

With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns

[Chorus]
Even if we both break down tonight
And you say you hate me, and we go to bed angry
I know everything will be alright
I'll be here waiting, I promise I'm changing
I just need...

[Verse 1]
A little time to show you I'm worth it
I know that I can be a difficult person
I'm a stress case, drive you up the wall when I'm workin'
Actually, I'm probably worse when I'm not, you don't deserve it
Make you nervous 'cause you know I'ma break soon
Every time I do, I say somethin' that hurts you
Actin' like I'm gone, but we both in the same room
I don't like to be wrong, which I know you relate to
And I know I make you feel like you're at the end of your rope
That's when I look at you and tell you I'd be better alone
Just the pride talkin', isn't it? 'Cause both of us know
I'm the definition of ""wreck"" if you look into my soul
Comes out the most when I feel I'm in a vulnerable place
Made a lot of mistakes I wish I knew how to erase
When I'm afraid, might get distant and I push you away
But no matter the case, I'ma do whatever it takes even if—

[Chorus]
Even if we both break down tonight
And you say you hate me, and we go to bed angry
I know everything will be alright
I'll be here waiting, I promise I'm changing

I, I need time (Oh, oh)
I just need time (Oh)
I, I need time (Oh)
Time (Oh), time (Oh)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, way before I bought you the ring
We were fighting back and forth like you were wearin' the thing
Two passionate people not afraid to say what they think
Lead to passionate conversation when it's hard to agree
You know me well, sittin' on the edge of my seat
Lookin' at life, overanalyzin' everything
Always depressed, tryna find a better version of me
Searching for somethin' I know's prolly right in front of my feet
Stubborn as me? Maybe not, but you're close to it
Got a lot of issues, I'm tryin' to work through 'em
Going to therapy for you's somethin' that's worth doin'
When I know you been there for me through all of my worst moments
And I know it hurts knowing that I carry this weight on my chest
Making it difficult for me to open up and connect
Lot of regrets, I apologize for all of the stress
That's not what I meant to do, you know I love you to death even if—

Ooh, he got money? I'm runnin' his wallet
You say you a killer, lil' nigga, stop it
In a shoot out your gun was droppin'
You really a ho
You pull up, I let that bitch blow
And just like some tissue, we wipin' yo nose
I was on stage with the strap at my show
If you playin' my bro, put a tag on yo' toe
Run a nigga up, send 'em straight to the doctor
Two bullets in his chest make a fuck nigga holla

Hopped off the bus then hopped in a Porsche (Panamera)

Bet you ain't ever met a nigga love swimmin'
Pull up like Tracy McGrady from the Pistons

I play with fire, sometimes I burn bridges
Bet you ain't ever met a nigga love swimmin'
Pull up like Tracy McGrady from the Pistons
Gotta keep a pistol for a fuck nigga dissin'
Bet this choppa make him dance like a disco

[Chorus: NLE Choppa]
I am a menace, keep me a rack just like tennis
I'm with the shit like I'm Dennis
I started this shit I'ma finish
Niggas be hatin', tryna blemish my image
Who want the smoke? .223 came with the scope
Extended clip long as a rope
We wipe his nose, just like he had him a cold
I knew that boy was a ho

[Outro: NLE Choppa]
I might just OD, percs killin' me slowly
Feelin' like I'm Kobe, can't nann nigga hold me
If you wanna run up on me, shoot 'em like Ginobili
And I'm with the shit, lil' homie, yeah, like I'm Toby, yeah
And I'm with the shit, lil' homie, yeah, like I'm Toby, yeah, bitch
(Like I'm Toby, like a school shooter named Toby)

[Letra de ""Por Eso Vine""]

[Intro]
O-O-Ovy On The Drums

[Pre-Estribillo: Paulo Londra]
Me dijeron que te vieron mal
Que ya ni siquiera hablás igual
Tu mirada apagada
Ya no se ve como ante', ma'
Ya no baila' como ante', ma'
Ya no ríe' como ante', ma'
Pero ya no, ya no puedo
Eso va a terminar
Por eso vine como director de cine
A decir que cambia tu rol
Y que a ese libreto mejor que lo tires

[Estribillo: Paulo Londra]
Porque vine pal' rescate
Como un soldado pal' combate
Como Superman para salvarte
Te traje helado y chocolate, y una buena charla
Porque vine pal' rescate
Como un soldado pal' combate
Como Superman para salvarte
Te traje helado y chocolate, y una buena charla

[Verso 1: Paulo Londra & Ovy On The Drums]
Ma', no puedo verte así
Era rosa y ahora gris
Daría lo que fuera por sacarte una sonrisa que me gusta a mí
Entiende que te quiero ayudar
Que te quiero salvar
Que no puedo dejar caer un ángel así
Que se esfume ese tonto que no te valora y encima no te hace feliz (No)
Te tiene apagada y a mí me da rabia porque eres sol para mí
Eso no va que ese bobo a ti te trate mal (No; no)
Eso lo convierte en un patán (¡Ay!)
Yo lo voa' poner en su lugar
Eso no puede seguir
Eso no puede seguir
No, no, no (Eso no puede seguir)

[Pre-Estribillo: Paulo Londra & Ovy On The Drums]

Que ya ni siquiera hablás igual (Eh, eh)

Ya no se ve como ante', ma' (Oh, oh)
Ya no baila' como ante', ma' (Oh)
Ya no ríe' como ante', ma' (Oh)

I look around, but it's you I can't replace

I keep crying baby, baby, please

She digging me and I’m cuffing her friend
She ig'-ing you while we fucking for fun
I got her suckin' her thumb, that’s my lil' baby
She call me daddy like grandmama baby
If this Sunday dinner, my hand on her gravy
I been on the craziest wave, if I'm on the stage
An M is my minimum wage
This ain't no kennel, behave
Niggas is with all that barking, we send 'em a stray
So in a way we the dogcatchers
How many bullets your dawg catchin'?

When they should keep eye on they bitch ’cause baby girl coming with son
Niggas be judging my moves, but please tell me, what have you done?
My cousin might air out the party for fun
Pistol grips get to squeezing
Wish a nigga would like Liam Neeson
I don’t even need a reason, loyalty over treason
Bitch nigga, come and see me
Put some respect on my name
What side of my city I claim
I try to stay in my lane
Took my advance and put a Caprice on them thangs
I'm Beatties Ford ’til the wheels fall
Know some niggas probably pissed off
Who would thought I made it this far?
Gold Mouf, bitch, fuck 'em all

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I woke up for some money, ayy, lil' bitch
Too many opps in here, tell me who you with

[Verse 3: DaBaby]
I just put diamonds on all of my teeth, now they probably think I ain't intelligent
In the homicide unit interrogation, asking questions, you know I ain’t tell 'em shit
Bitches call me a jock, all-American
I'm at the top of my class with my lettermen
I remember back in college, bitches knocking on my dorm door
I ain't never let 'em in
Now you know that that's cap, know I hit a few
Ain't no job, I'm selling gas like I'm Jiffy Lube
I had a freak, used to fuck while her boyfriend in class
I hit her from the back from like 10 to 2
No back and forth with these rappers
They mention me, dissin' me
No talkin' back, I won't mention you
Watch, when I come put that iron on your ass and I dip
They gon' want me to snitch in my interviews
I'm on fire, bitch, I'm lit, but I'm really cool
Don't acknowledge the shrimps when they ridicule
They don't come out after dark, bitch, I swim with the sharks
You ain't got enough heart, get a bigger pool
Wanna fight but he bigger, I ain't really trippin'
Reach under my shirt, grab a bigger tool
I got a Glock with a dick, let's get physical
They gon' be hollerin' out, ""Rip,"" and they missin' you
They got me started, I might as well finish it (Talk your shit, nigga)
I'm from Charlotte, you know how these niggas do
Baby

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]

I done seen it all, oh my God
Uh

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Nothing new under the sun, nobody fucking with son
I got a couple of sons, a couple of guns
A couple of niggas that bust up the party and fuck up the fun
She digging me and I’m cuffing her friend
She ig'-ing you while we fucking for fun
I got her suckin' her thumb, that’s my lil' baby
She call me daddy like grandmama baby
If this Sunday dinner, my hand on her gravy
I been on the craziest wave, if I'm on the stage
An M is my minimum wage
This ain't no kennel, behave
Niggas is with all that barking, we send 'em a stray
So in a way we the dogcatchers
How many bullets your dawg catchin'?
Sawed-off, raw dog fashion
Hauled off, hope God catch him, damn

[Intro: Young Nudy]
Tell 'em, slime

[Verse 1: Young Nudy]
Yeah, I am the king of the E.A.​
Get this bitch screwed like the DJ (Big slime)
Yeah, I am the shit where we play
We got the chalk where we play (Okay)
Yeah, come through the city
We gon’ chop your ass up just like some sushi (Yeah)
AK-47, stick go stupid (Yeah)
Draw the money out, all the way...

[Verse 2: JID]
Okay, lil' dirty, nappy-headed East Atlanta nigga
Father said that I was a force
.44, Hank Aaron chrome
Wanna make it home? Then get out the Porsche
Let a nigga cover FADER 'fore I have to fade a nigga at the FADER Fort
It’s tomato or tomato, either way, the boy the greatest
Play it, I won't say it no more
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown
Board of Education vs. Brown
I was bored of education, left the town
Fuck a résumé and fuck a cap and gown
Fuck a background check back 'round when I get the check
Nigga, that's now

[Chorus: JID]
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown (Oh, shit)
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown, crown, crown

[Verse 3: Bas]
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
Picked up the pad, picked up the slack
Pick of the litter, don't litter no bag
Bassy been pickin’ up racks, raps comin’ clearer than Acuvue 2
And I'm back in the booth
Got ’em hackin' a Shaq 'cause they lackin' the juice
Niggas droppin’ the ball, they on Shaqtin' a Fool
Actavis drool down the side of yo face
We ain't jackin' it, we ain't dappin' them fools
Get a napkin, you dudes is embarassin'
Who going crazy like us? No comparison
Dreamville like Marion Jones on the steroids
Y'all niggas slow as a heroin high
Y'all had a year, y'all had a year
Y'all had a year, but you let it go by
Yee

[Chorus: JID]
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown (Oh, shit)
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown, crown, crown

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
Dreamville head honcho
Bitch, we came from nothin' just like the big bang theory
That poverty stains kept the pain buried
And covered the shame with a dream
We would have fortune and fame
A mil' in the bank, chameleon paint turned cranberry
Now little Jermaine got the same story
As that boy out of St. Vincent-St. Mary: G.O.A.T.​
All hail King Cole, first of his name, long may he reign
The boy got the throne, but you know it ain't a game
Ville nigga, I was born in the same
Pressure cooker that's been known to bust a lump of coal and make a diamond
Two six, we enrolled in Reaganomics
Crew sick, we the Golden State of rhyming, on God

[Verse 5: Johnny Venus]
You could die today, so be hell to pay
I'm a livin', breathin', schemin' testimony
So don't test me, homie, put that in ya, homie
Put a foot up that ass, you a steppin' stone
All my niggas ain't gettin' no sleep
All of my niggas be chasin' their dreams
Ooh, I'm a force of nature, I can't wait to date ya
I was havin' problems 'til I had to break through
All my tattoos for sure, they ain't never for show
Might get tattoo'd on tour, tell ya ho get the door
Spend my time makin' love to your thoughts
Gon' get in line, baby, slut up your mind
It's a brand new season, I'm a righteous heathen
I take on the challenge and I leave it bleedin'
I was down bad, now I'm even Steven
And I'm leavin', leavin' every fuckin' weekend (Oh)

[Chorus: JID]
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown (Oh, shit)

[Hook]
Du siehst mich im Fernseh'n, ich bin in den Charts
Hab’ mein neues Auto mit Bargeld bezahlt
Als ich dich gebraucht hab', warst du nicht mehr da
Früher war ich dir egal
Aber jetzt rufst du, jetzt rufst du
Jetzt rufst du an
Jetzt rufst du, jetzt rufst du
Jetzt rufst du an

[Part 1]
Ich muss weiter, mach' Geschäfte
Stell’ mein Handy auf stumm
Du hast mir nicht geglaubt
Und jetzt frag' ich mich, „Warum
Rufst du an?“
Ganz bestimmt nicht, weil du mich nur fragen willst
Wie es mir heute so geht
Und während ich mal wieder meine Gage zähl'
Merkst du, dass dir etwas fehlt

[Hook]

Jetzt rufst du, jetzt rufst du
Jetzt rufst du an

[Part 2]
Ja, du rufst an, ich hab' kein'n Empfang
Es ist leider viel zu spät
Was ein Zufall, bin in Dubai
Während du dein Kleingeld zählst
Hallo, hallo! Ich glaub’, du hast dich verwählt
Es tut mir zwar leid, doch ich kenn’ dich nicht mehr
Ich bin wieder unterwegs
Flugmodus an, sitz' im Jet Richtung Meer

[Intro: Salmo]
Boy, Lebon al mic
Sardinian finest
Yeah
Machete Mixtape Volume 4
Ho paura di uscire
Yeah
MACE with the beats
Vai

[Strofa 1: Lazza]
Mi sa che faccio tardi pure oggi (yah)
Meno i paparazzi come Kanye (yah)
Ho un safari in bocca, Zimbabwe (yah)
Tu ancora senza gafi come Austin Powers (ehi)
Sto sfidando coi dadi la sorte (ehi)
Sono in giro, ho gli occhi semichiusi (ehi)
Se stasera mi chiama la morte
Le urlo: ""Bella"" come in Scary Movie

[Strofa 2: Salmo]
E alla fine sono uscito
Tipo un funerale non mi serve l'invito
Versami da bere, sono un tipo forbito
Lo giro col dito
Nel letto ho una cavalla tipo Don Vito
È il mio anno, me lo sento, che dici, tento?
Mi danno il premio, sono un certo Luigi Techno
Faccio prima a dirlo che rifarlo
Tu sei una pussy, bro', sei Gary Barlow

[Strofa 3: Lazza]
Torno da una data, ho fatto pesca grossa
Zzala, fra', è la svolta, senza freccia, apposta
Tipo che batosta
Tipo che sul treno di ritorno siamo al peggio, un Fecciarossa
Mi dicono ancora: ""Ma ti contieni?""
Vieni o non vieni, prendi e non chiedi
Finito il mio show, ehi, chiama i pompieri
Tu pari le palle, come i portieri (ahahahah)

[Pre-Ritornello: Salmo]
Sai quel film che ti dicevo?
Non lo trovo, dove Cristo è finito?
Ho paura di uscire, ehi
E alla fine sono uscito (woop)
E alla fine sono uscito

[Ritornello: Salmo]
Bevi questo, fuma quello
Tira questo, tira quello
Bevi questo, fuma quello
Tira que-
E alla fine sono uscito (woop)

[Strofa 4: Lazza]
V-v-vorrei d-d-dirti una c-c-cosa
M-m-ma non so d-dirla
Oh ma': ""Sto sborrando"" (sto sborrando)
Sì, sopra tua figlia, ehi
Oggi niente storie o vanno su YouTube
Che se ne bevo un'altra vedo i Looney Tunes
Meglio se mi leghi come Scooby Doo
Ho paura di uscire, sì, ma tu di più

[Strofa 5: Salmo]
Cazzo metti la mia faccia su Di Più TV?
Finisci a pezzi in una sacca su una BMW
Ci becchi in giro tipo street food
A te non t'ho mai visto tipo un bigfoot
Il mio crew, Clint Eastwood
Senti Lebon al mic, ti viene un ictus
Certi rapper non li fanno più
Io sono ancora in giro, a casa non ci torno più
Così eh, così eh, così eh, proprio così eh
Così eh, così eh, così eh

[Bridge: Salmo]
Bevi questo, fuma quello
Tira questo, tira quello
Bevi questo, fuma quello
Tira questo
E alla fine sono uscito

[Ritornello: Salmo]
Bevi questo, fuma quello
Tira questo, tira quello
Bevi questo, fuma quello
Tira quello
E alla fine sono uscito (ue)

[Outro: Salmo]

(Io non voglio tornare a casa)
Io non voglio più tornare a casa
Che nessuno mi riporti a casa
Voglio solo fare fuori il sole

Girls get messy like a motherfuckin' mixtape
Smellin' like money and I'm lookin' like sex
I'm outside for real with the slimes and the slatts
Nigga ride wave, then the nigga get taxed
Fendi snowpants and I fill 'em up with racks
They all ball cap, and this all facts
No, I don't relax and I don't lack

[Verse 2: Bas & Guapdad 4000]
Demons, they follow me deep in the dark
Niggas got problems with being a boss
We ain't been home but we hear all the talkin'
Hit 'em with hollows and clean 'em with salt
Salt in the wound and my heart in the cooler
Frozen like I gave my heart to my jeweler
Told him to make a new piece out of this
Ever since, I just can't give no fuck 'bout no bitch (It's a check)

[Chorus: Guapdad 4000]
Baby, had to bustdown on the AP, yeah
Baby, ain't no rich styles on you lately, yeah
I got fans in Costa Rica (Fans), I got bands in Costa Rica (Big bands)
I got fans in Costa Rica (Big fans), I got bands in Costa Rica

[Verse 3: Jace]
Got the Mike Jack' nose, just before the vitiligo
Norman Bates with the eights, I'ma go psycho
Laundromat with a temper, this a vicious cycle
Feel like Rihanna, bitches go wherever I go
Go against the grain like I'm battlin' the silo
I'm going out west like I'm motherfuckin' Fievel
LeBron in the finals, motherfuckin' five-oh
Nigga bettin' under 5'4"", hell if I know

[Verse 4: Mez]
Niggas got me tight like Arthur's fist and shit
Like I'm not an arsonist and shit
Not a nigga that you wanna argue with
'Cause then you fucking with your future like Larsa Pippen, shit
Boy, I'm like a barber with this shit
You get out the chair, you get in the chair
The things in the mirror, the way they appear
You look to the rear, my niggas is near, my niggas revered
You fuckin' with Mez, you fuckin' with Heirs, nigga

[Chorus: Guapdad 4000]
Baby, had to bustdown on the AP, yeah
Baby, ain't no rich styles on you lately, yeah
I got fans in Costa Rica (Fans), I got bands in Costa Rica (Big bands)
I got fans in Costa Rica (Big fans), I got bands in Costa Rica

[Verse 5: Smokepurpp]
I got balled up hundreds in my pocket
Diamonds on me water like a faucet
Got a lot of bands in Costa Rica
Lot of hoes in Costa Rica, got a passport in my pocket
And I flew with the stick, it's a rocket
Forty-five on me, shit hot like a pocket
You ain't talkin' money, it's nonsense
Got your baby mama doing drugs in the moshpit

[Verse 6: JID & Guapdad 4000]
Top of the morning to anybody who thought it was beddy-bye
Jiddy, I'm like a Jedi
Mind tricks live inside of your head, I
Devilish, red eyes, never been on a redeye
Or shit, I be high, I forget
Shawty said I be wildin' and trippin' when I'm on a lick
Score a penny or twenty, I'm Dominique Wilkins and shit
Really I flew to Costa Rica with an AP
At the airport, this girl ask me, ""Hey, are you Swae Lee?”
Wow (It's a check)

[Chorus: Guapdad 4000]
Baby, had to bustdown on the AP, yeah
Baby, ain't no rich styles on you lately, yeah
I got fans in Costa Rica (Fans), I got bands in Costa Rica (Big bands)
I got fans in Costa Rica (Big fans), I got bands in Costa Rica

[Verse 7: Buddy & Ski Mask the Slump God]
Suffering succotash
She think it's all puddycat but, hell, I ain't even mad
I started sucking on her titty, put my thumb in her ass
She had a little one, it really wasn't nothin' to grab, I did it anyway
Nigga, I'm a bag
Comin' down the 91, flyin', doin' the dash
We goin' in today (Ayy)
And I been writing my ass off, Ernest Hemingway (Bitch)
I ain't got shit else to say

[Verse 8: Ski Mask the Slump God & Guapdad 4000]
I got too much skills
I flow like the water, so surprised I did not grow gills
And I am your father like you was Luke Skywalker
And I conquer and let it burn like Usher's perm and kill confirmed
You look concerned, respect is earned, uh
You really be in it, B, gotta be kiddin' me, uh
You really be sickenin', I got the remedy, uh
I'm feelin' like Goku, bitch, I need your energy, uh
Um, okay, huh, goin' on a date with an AK, huh (Yup)
Ayy, okay, goin' on a date with an AK, ayy (It's a check)

Com si plogués llençant els bitllets pels aires
Un dia per Mumbai i al següent a Malta
Sempre ben escoltada a prova de bala

[Pre-Tornada]

I el que voldria és tenir un Bentley
De color blanc i un de color verd
Però tot això sé que no ho puc fer
Fins el dia que tingui molts diners
I el que voldria és tenir…

Fucking money, man
Només vull veure bitllets de cent
Fucking money, man
Signe del dòlar dintre la ment
Fucking money, man
Només vull veure bitllets de cent
Fucking money, man
Signe del dòlar dintre la ment

[Estrofa 2]
(Díselo, Rosi)
Que jo sé que he nascut per ser milionària
Perquè em tanquin el Louvre així com al MACBA (Fucking Money, la mixtape)

Mmh, niggas want smoke, I want it too
Roses are red, my diamonds are blue
Pockets is green, a permanent hue
My niggas get work like assignments is due
Just made a mil', I counted it once
I think I go spread it around in the slums
2-6 god, that's where I'm from
Help me get used to the sound of the drum
Rolls Royce riding down Sunset
I must get a crib in LA
Fuck a nigga finna tell me?
Catch him slippin', Cinderell-ayy
Big ass chopper make God flinch
Ducking from the boys in the field
Just as good as poison with the steel
Hesitation always get you killed, nigga

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
I wanna pop my shit
I wanna cop my whip in cash
On that note, pull up on them folks
In an all black Ghost like Christmas Past
Vicious ass
Low-key rich with the same outfit that I did just have
Pardon the smoke, that's just my staff
Quik Stop, never seen this much gas, nigga
I got a story to tell you to speak for the niggas that never could speak for theyself
I was off Cumberland Road when a couple of niggas mistook me for somebody else
I put the pedal to metal when I seen the muzzle, I couldn't help but think to myself
Boy, keep your ass in the house, the city is bad for your health

Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become

Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows

Surrounded, but still alone

Por qué razón, dime para qué (Para qué, para qué)
Ya no te presto atención (Ninguna)
Desde hace tiempo le puse punto final (Sí)

[Coro: J Balvin]
¿Qué pretendes tú llamándome a esta hora? (Yeah, hora)
Esa actitud la conozco ya (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
Sabes qué hacer muy bien para envolverme (Envolverme)
Pero esta vez es muy tarde ya (Uah, oh-oh-oh)

Estas no son horas de llamar (No)
Al meno' que me lo quiera' mamar
Que quiera' prender, que quiera' quemar (Uh-huh)
Hablando claro ya tú me cae' hasta mal (Ja)
Por ti me metí pastilla' y me fui de overflow Lamar (Woh)
Pero tú no ere' una Kardashian (No)
Contigo no me tiro, porque si no las retro se me embachan
De Snapchat te borré, de Facebook te borré
De Instagram te borré, de mi vida te borré (¡Plo!)

[Pre-Coro: Bad Bunny]
Y ahora quiere' volver (¡Nah!)
Nah, tú lo que quiere' e' joder (¡Wuh!)
Pero no se va a poder (Fuck you)

[Intro]
Bring me higher love, love
Bring me higher love

[Verse 1]
Think about it, there must be a higher love
Down in the heart or hidden in the stars above
Without it, life is wasted time
Look inside your heart, and I'll look inside mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair?
We walk the line and try to see
Falling behind in what could be, oh

[Chorus]
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?

[Post-Chorus]
Bring me higher love, love
Bring me higher love (Oh)
Bring me higher love, love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me higher love, love
Bring me higher love (Oh)
Bring me higher love, love
Bring me a higher love

[Verse 2]
Worlds are turning, and we're just hanging on
Facing our fear, and standing out there alone
A yearning, yeah, and it's real to me
There must be someone who's feeling for me

[Pre-Chorus]
Things look so bad everywhere

[Verse 1: Chris Brown, with Ink]
If I'm out at the bar havin' a night on the town
Life of the party, pourin' shots of the brown
And you see me from the street but I don't turn around
Would you say, ""Hi""? Would you keep going?
If I told your family that you didn't mean nothing
If you posted about it and I didn't even comment
If the songs weren't true, but you still feel something
Would you still come looking for me?

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Ink]
Oh, don't go reaching out
'Cause you can't have everything
Your head and your heart won't feel the same
Even if it feels like it every time

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Ink]
Don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
It ain't always summer in June

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Might run across your mind but don't worry 'bout me, no
My heart is back in one piece, it ain't skipped a beat, no
Feeling rested up, I ain't missing sleep, no-oh
Don't take it personal if I can't reply now
I'm distant 'cause I don't wanna be reached now
Won't let the ghosts of our past weigh my future down
I'm liberated
Energy's like a circle, it comes back around
Reciprocated
Don't shed no more tears
Won't gain no empathy from me
In the upcoming years
Oh, I don't need your pity

[Chorus: Justin Bieber, with Chris Brown & Ink, Ink]
Don't check on me
Oh, don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
And it looks like winter for you

[Verse 3: Chris Brown, with Ink]
Ain't call you back 'cause I let it go
I had to focus energy and just let it flow
And when we ride low, we were already gone
It wouldn't mean anymore to me now
I know it hurts you so bad just to see me happy
That I finally moved on, and you thought it wouldn't happen
At times I used to cry when the world was laughing
But I act like I didn't notice

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Ink, Ink]
Oh, don't go reaching out
'Cause you can't have everything
You can't kill a flame with gasoline
Even if it feels like it every time
No matter how hard you try

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Ink & Justin Bieber]
Don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
It ain't always summer in June

[Letra de ""UN PESO"" ft. Marciano Cantero]

[Coro: Bad Bunny]
¿Pa' qué me vas a amar si ya te dije adiós?
Si ya me despedí de ti, no quiero saber más de tus besos
¿Pa' qué me vas a amar? Ya te di tu perdón
El rencor nunca ha estado en mí
Ahora lo que hagas me vale un peso
¿Pa' que me vas a amar?

[Verso 1: J Balvin]
¿Pa' qué? si estamos en otras etapa' y ya te olvidé?
Si por ti me jodí, caí y me levanté
Con el que te venías, ya se fue
Me han llega'o par de razones que ya has roto corazones
Tratando 'e llenar vacíos que ni llenas con galones
Sí, esta es pa' que borracha la entone'
De ti solo extraño hacerlo sin condone'
Y con razón, tan poquito te dolió
De cora' que no fui yo el que la nave despegó
Y tu corazón idiota siempre me extrañará, baby

[Coro: Bad Bunny]
¿Pa' qué me vas a amar si ya te dije adiós?
Si ya me despedí de ti, no quiero saber más de tus besos
¿Pa' qué me vas a amar? Ya te di tu perdón
El rencor nunca ha estado en mí
Ahora lo que hagas me vale un peso

[Verso 2: Bad Bunny]
Yo te amaba, yo te quería
Pero ya se acabaron esos días
Ahora lloras, arrepentida
Pensando en mí, mientra' el café se te enfría
Estoy seguro que extrañas mi lunar
Y no tener a nadie pa' desayunar
Lo siento, mi amor, solo me di mi lugar
Busca otro corazón con el que jugar
A ti fui religioso, yo te adoré
La luna sabe lo que por ti lloré
Cuando estaba triste y tú nunca viniste
Pero normal, normal
Tranquila, que de ti yo no voy a hablar mal
Te puedo perdonar, pero nunca olvidar
No me hables bonito, vuelvo y repito

[Coro: J Balvin, Bad Bunny & J Balvin]
Pa' qué me vas a amar si ya te dije adiós?
Si ya me despedí de ti, no quiero saber más de tus besos
¿Pa' qué me vas a amar? Ya te di tu perdón
El rencor nunca ha estado en mí
Ahora lo que hagas me vale un peso

[Verso 3: Marciano Cantero]
No te podrás hacer la cirugía estética del alma
Para cambiar algo que no te falla
Tu piedra angular, tu piedra angular
¡Qué me vas a amar!
Yo existía si me imaginabas
Y daba un brinco si decías ""rana""
Pero me cansó ser tu pendejo

[Puente: Marciano Cantero]
¿Por qué perdiste sensibilidad?
Te fuiste sola sin mirar atrás
Aprendiste a diferenciar, lo que parece y lo que es
Lo que está escrito en las estrellas
A lo que está escrito en un papel
Otros amores también hay, como la novia de Forrest Gump
Dice el reloj en la pared, si nuestro amor terminó ayer
¿Qué me vas a amar, qué me vas a amar?

[Coro: Marciano Cantero & Bad Bunny]
¿Pa' qué me vas a amar si ya te dije adiós?
Si ya me despedí de ti, no quiero saber más de tus besos
¿Pa' qué me vas a amar? Ya te di tu perdón
El rencor nunca ha estado en mí
Ahora lo que hagas me vale un peso

¿Pa' que me vas a amar?

[Verso 1: J Balvin]
¿Pa' qué? si estamos en otras etapa' y ya te olvidé?
Si por ti me jodí, caí y me levanté
Con el que te venías, ya se fue
Me han llega'o par de razones que ya has roto corazones
Tratando 'e llenar vacíos que ni llenas con galones
Sí, esta es pa' que borracha la entone'
De ti solo extraño hacerlo sin condone'
Y con razón, tan poquito te dolió
De cora' que no fui yo el que la nave despegó
Y tu corazón idiota siempre me extrañará, baby

[Coro: Bad Bunny]
¿Pa' qué me vas a amar si ya te dije adiós?
Si ya me despedí de ti, no quiero saber más de tus besos
¿Pa' qué me vas a amar? Ya te di tu perdón
El rencor nunca ha estado en mí
Ahora lo que hagas me vale un peso

[Verso 2: Bad Bunny]
Yo te amaba, yo te quería
Pero ya se acabaron esos días
Ahora lloras, arrepentida
Pensando en mí, mientra' el café se te enfría
Estoy seguro que extrañas mi lunar
Y no tener a nadie pa' desayunar
Lo siento, mi amor, solo me di mi lugar
Busca otro corazón con el que jugar
A ti fui religioso, yo te adoré
La luna sabe lo que por ti lloré
Cuando estaba triste y tú nunca viniste
Pero normal, normal
Tranquila, que de ti yo no voy a hablar mal
Te puedo perdonar, pero nunca olvidar
No me hables bonito, vuelvo y repito

[Coro: J Balvin, Bad Bunny & J Balvin]
Pa' qué me vas a amar si ya te dije adiós?
Si ya me despedí de ti, no quiero saber más de tus besos
¿Pa' qué me vas a amar? Ya te di tu perdón
El rencor nunca ha estado en mí
Ahora lo que hagas me vale un peso

[Verso 3: Marciano Cantero]
No te podrás hacer la cirugía estética del alma
Para cambiar algo que no te falla
Tu piedra angular, tu piedra angular
¡Qué me vas a amar!
Yo existía si me imaginabas
Y daba un brinco si decías ""rana""
Pero me cansó ser tu pendejo

[Puente: Marciano Cantero]
¿Por qué perdiste sensibilidad?
Te fuiste sola sin mirar atrás
Aprendiste a diferenciar, lo que parece y lo que es
Lo que está escrito en las estrellas
A lo que está escrito en un papel
Otros amores también hay, como la novia de Forrest Gump
Dice el reloj en la pared, si nuestro amor terminó ayer
¿Qué me vas a amar, qué me vas a amar?

[Coro: Marciano Cantero & Bad Bunny]
¿Pa' qué me vas a amar si ya te dije adiós?
Si ya me despedí de ti, no quiero saber más de tus besos
¿Pa' qué me vas a amar? Ya te di tu perdón
El rencor nunca ha estado en mí
Ahora lo que hagas me vale un peso

[Part 1: Shirin David]
Handy lautlos, schließ' die Jalousien
Keiner soll wissen, dass es uns wieder gibt
Meine Freunde denken, zwischen uns ist Krieg
Hab' dich so oft verflucht, trotzdem wieder hier
Also machen wir das Beste draus
Meine beste Freundin meint, das geht hässlich aus
Mag sein, dass ich Schwäche zeig'
Doch ich schalt' den Kopf aus, weil mein Herz dich braucht
Fühl' mich wohl in der Illusion
Deine Witze sind ab heut wieder gut
War schon durch, doch will's wiederhol'n
Denn ohne dich war's wie auf Entzug

Y a bien des choses qu'il faudrait qu'on précise

Que des barrières entre nous, ça parle en visio (uh-uhh)
Et pour t'atteindre, dois-je passer par le physio ? (ah-ahh)
J'coupe les ponts, passe-moi les ciseaux, tu joues la schizo'
Et pour toutes ces fois où tu m'as bourré l'crâne
Je refuse de répondre par le mal
Et puis tu me caches des choses au plus profond de toi

Si supiera' que me gustas tanto
Que me tiemblan las manos cuando la tengo cerca (No sé ni cómo decirte)
Que no me basta con ser su amigo
Y para mí es un castigo ver que no se dé cuenta (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Se supone que esto no pasara (W, Yandel)
Pero llegan las ganas (D.Y.), y dime quién las frena (Eh, eh-eh)
Se supone que no respondiera (Eh)
Si aparecía el deseo (Eh, eh), tocándome a la puerta

[Coro: Yandel]
Pero el color de sus ojos (Eh), su pelo (Eh-eh), su cara
Esa mujer lo tiene todo (Eh), ¿cómo no desearla? (Eh)
Y es que el color de sus ojos (Eh), su pelo (Eh), su cara
Esa mujer lo tiene todo, ¿cómo no desearla?

[Verso 1: Daddy Yankee & Yandel]
D-D-D, D.Y. (Luny)
No sabes cómo te pienso, pienso, pienso
Esto es algo tan intenso
Trato de esconder todos mis deseos cuanto te veo
Eres mi primer pensamiento del día (Eh)
A mi ritmo cardíaco, le encontré melodía
Te diré mi secreto, pa' cambiar el libreto (Eh)
Porque te quiero amar a tiempo completo
Loco, loco, enamorado de ti
Sueño con el día que me puedas decir:
""¿Tú me quieres (No-rou-rou), o me amas?"" (Eh, eh)
Hice todo para olvidarme de ti
Peleé con mi mente y no lo conseguí
Algo tienes (Eh, eh), que me llama (¡Sube!)

[Coro: Yandel]
El color de sus ojos (Eh), su pelo (Eh-eh), su cara
Esa mujer lo tiene todo (Eh), ¿cómo no desearla? (Eh)
Es que el color de sus ojos (Eh), su pelo (Eh), su cara
Esa mujer lo tiene todo, ¿cómo no desearla?

[Verso 2: Wisin & Daddy Yankee]
(¡W!, ¿ah?)
Ya no puedo disimular
Yo sé que entre tú y yo puede pasar algo especial (Princesa)
Baby, déjate llevar (¡W!)
Erízame los pelos (¡Duro!), dale, caramelo (¡Duro!)
El tiburón 'tá esperando que muerdas el anzuelo
Piensa que yo soy tuyo y que tú eres mía (Tra-tra-tra)
Llegó el tiguere W a cumplir tus fantasías
Te sueño y te imagino en mi cama, no quiero más dramas
Tú sabes que tu cuerpo, me llama
Aclara conmigo, yo no quiero ser más tu amigo
Siéntate tranquila y escucha lo que te digo

Se supone que esto no pasara (W, Yandel)
Pero llegan las ganas (D.Y.), y dime quién las frena (Eh, eh-eh)
Se supone que no respondiera (Eh)
Si aparecía el deseo (Eh, eh), tocándome a la puerta

[Coro: Yandel]
Pero el color de sus ojos (Eh), su pelo (Eh-eh), su cara
Esa mujer lo tiene todo (Eh), ¿cómo no desearla? (Eh)
Y es que el color de sus ojos (Eh), su pelo (Eh), su cara
Esa mujer lo tiene todo, ¿cómo no desearla?

[Verso 1: Daddy Yankee & Yandel]
D-D-D, D.Y. (Luny)
No sabes cómo te pienso, pienso, pienso
Esto es algo tan intenso
Trato de esconder todos mis deseos cuanto te veo
Eres mi primer pensamiento del día (Eh)
A mi ritmo cardíaco, le encontré melodía
Te diré mi secreto, pa' cambiar el libreto (Eh)
Porque te quiero amar a tiempo completo
Loco, loco, enamorado de ti
Sueño con el día que me puedas decir:
""¿Tú me quieres (No-rou-rou), o me amas?"" (Eh, eh)
Hice todo para olvidarme de ti
Peleé con mi mente y no lo conseguí
Algo tienes (Eh, eh), que me llama (¡Sube!)

[Coro: Yandel]
El color de sus ojos (Eh), su pelo (Eh-eh), su cara
Esa mujer lo tiene todo (Eh), ¿cómo no desearla? (Eh)
Es que el color de sus ojos (Eh), su pelo (Eh), su cara
Esa mujer lo tiene todo, ¿cómo no desearla?

[Verso 2: Wisin & Daddy Yankee]
(¡W!, ¿ah?)
Ya no puedo disimular
Yo sé que entre tú y yo puede pasar algo especial (Princesa)
Baby, déjate llevar (¡W!)
Erízame los pelos (¡Duro!), dale, caramelo (¡Duro!)
El tiburón 'tá esperando que muerdas el anzuelo
Piensa que yo soy tuyo y que tú eres mía (Tra-tra-tra)
Llegó el tiguere W a cumplir tus fantasías
Te sueño y te imagino en mi cama, no quiero más dramas
Tú sabes que tu cuerpo, me llama
Aclara conmigo, yo no quiero ser más tu amigo
Siéntate tranquila y escucha lo que te digo

[Pre-Coro: Yandel & Daddy Yankee]
Si supiera' que me gustas tanto
Que me tiemblan las manos cuando la tengo cerca (Eh, eh, eh, eh)
Que no me basta con ser su amigo
Y para mí es un castigo ver que no se dé cuenta (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Se supone que esto no pasara (Eh)
Pero llegan las ganas (Eh), y dime quién las frena (Eh, eh-eh)
Se supone que no respondiera (Eh)
Si aparecía el deseo (Eh, eh), tocándome a la puerta

[Coro: Yandel]

[Verse 1]
Yeah, when I grow up, you know what I wanna be?
Take a seat, let me tell you my ridiculous dreams
I wanna rap, yeah, I know it's hard to believe
And I can tell you're already thinkin' I will never succeed
But I'm okay with it, I admit the lyrics are weak
I've been workin' on 'em, I'll be good eventually
I understand you gotta crawl before you get to your feet
But I been running for a while, they ain't ready for me, ahh
I know this prolly isn't really realistic
And honestly, I might not ever make a difference
But that don't make a difference, I'ma have to risk it
I've been crunchin' numbers, you ain't gotta be a mathematician
To see the odds ain't rootin' for me
I can't lie though, it's kinda how I like it to be
The underdog, yeah, you prolly think you know what I mean
But what I'm saying is they ever push me, I'm gonna swing, yeah
I could go to college, get in debt like everybody else
Graduate and prolly get a job that doesn't pay the bills
That don't make a lot of sense to me, forget the Happy Meals
I don't like the dollar menu, I would rather make a meal
Huh? Make a mil'? Nah, I said make a meal
Home-cookin', get the grill, how you want it? Pretty well?
Everything I see is overdone to me, I'm not Adele
But I'ma get a record deal and say hello to mass appeal

[Chorus]
When I grow up, I just want to pay my bills
Rappin' about the way I feel (Oh, yeah)
I just want to make a couple mil'
Leave it to the fam in the will (Oh, yeah)
I just want to sign a record deal
Maybe buy a house up in the hills (Oh, yeah)
Might not be the best in my field
But I guarantee that I'ma die real
When I grow up

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, ayy
When I grow up
Yeah, yeah, ayy

[Verse 2]
I'ma make 'em notice me, rhymin' like it's poetry
Everything I oversee, I just like to overthink
Mockin' me, you pay the fee, no return and no receipts
Those of you that don't believe, quiet, you don't know a thing
Quiet when I'm tryna sing, quiet when I'm making beats
Quiet when I'm tryna think, sorry, I don't mean to scream
I just feel like no one really gets me and it's sad to see
'Cause someday I'ma grow up and show all of you it's meant to be (Yeah)
Anybody wanna hear me rap? ""No""
Come on, let me play a couple tracks, ""No""
Come on, I can spit it really fast, ""No""
You think I should throw this in the trash? ""No""
Tricked ya; haters, go away before I hit ya
I am not a beggar or a kiss-up
You don't understand? Well, I forgive ya
I am not a quitter, you ain't really think that, did ya?
Maybe someday I could even be up on the radio
Have a tour bus and maybe even play a couple shows
Everybody in the crowd singing every word I wrote
Tellin' me that I am not the only one that feels alone
Huh? You feel alone? Yeah, I kinda feel alone
Wonder if that feelin' ever goes away when you get old
Will I ever make it as an artist? I don't really know
Might not make a lot of dough
I'ma have to try it, though

[Chorus]
When I grow up
I just wanna pay my bills
Rappin' about the way I feel (Oh, yeah)
I just wanna make a couple mil'
Leave it to the fam in the will (Oh, yeah)
(Leave it to the fam in the will)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I just wanna sign a record deal
Maybe buy a house up in the hills (Okay, oh, yeah)
Might not be the best in my field (Ayy, ayy, yeah)
But I guarantee that I'ma die real
When I grow up
I just wanna pay my bills (Woo)
Rappin' about the way I feel (Oh, yeah)
(Yeah, the way I feel)
Yeah, I just wanna make a couple mil' (Ayy, couple mil')
Leave it to the fam in the will (Oh, yeah, to the fam in the will)
I just wanna sign a record deal (Woo)

[Intro: Bad Bunny]
No quiero saber de ti (No)
No sé qué haces aquí
Ya yo te lo advertí (Yeh, yeh)
Así que, mami, no te me ilusiones
Que pa' ti ya yo no escribo canciones
Lo que digan, me tiene sin cojones
Mala mía, bebé, no te encojones

[Coro: Bad Bunny]
Pero, en realidad, a ti ya yo te odio, odio (Huh)
Pasé de amor al odio (Odio)
Que me perdone Dios, pero te odio (¡Eh!)
¿Que no quiero na' contigo? Eso e' obvio (No, no, no, no, no)
Si quieres, te lo meto, pero será con odio, odio
Pasé de amor al odio (Odio)
Que me perdone Dios, pero te odio (¡Eh!)
¿Que no quiero na' contigo? Eso e' obvio
Si quieres, te lo meto, pero será con odio
(Yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh)

[Verso 1: J Balvin]
Tengo par de vídeos sexuales contigo por ahí (Sí)
Tú no te merece' a nadie el día 'e San Valentín (No, no)
Pa'l carajo con tu novio, quiero que no sea' feliz
Y en la calle se comente lo duro que yo te di (Wuh, wuh, wuh)
La calle y el trabajo (Huh), y los hoteles caros (Okay)
Si yo sabía cuánto ganabas, se me hizo raro (All right, all right)
En un yate en Miami, al otro día en Dubai (Wuh)
No me creas tan pendejo, ya eso e' lo que hay (Hay)
Rencor y remordimiento, sí
Lo tuyo y lo mío se fue con el viento, ey
Ando por ahí con otra, en tu asiento (Sí)
Ayer fuimos a comer y me gasté 500 (Ching!)
Y es por el maldito odio que ahora te tengo (Yeh)
Sí, voy a hacerte un velorio y de ti me vengo
Tranquila, de noche, tú vas a volver (Ajá)
Pidiendo que te lo haga solamente por placer y lo voy a hacer
Pero para que entiendas (Okay?)
Que si tienes tienda es pa' que la atiendas
Te confiaste y te creíste la jodienda (La jodienda)
Pa' ti ya no tengo espacio en mi agenda, baby
No te sorprendas (Wuh, wuh)
Creí que esto valía más que to'a mis prendas
Te confiaste y te creíste la jodienda
Y ahora quisiera perdonarte

[Coro: J Balvin]
Pero, en realidad, a ti ya yo te odio, odio (¿Cómo?)
Pasé de amor al odio
Que me perdone Dios, pero te odio
¿Que no quiero na' contigo? Eso es obvio
Si quieres, te lo meto, pero será con odio, odio
Pasé de amor al odio
Que me perdone Dios, pero te odio
¿Que no quiero na' contigo? Eso es obvio
Si quieres, te lo meto (Pero será con odio)

Te deseo lo peor (Eh), que tengas mala suerte
Que sufras en la vida y hasta después de la muerte (Eh)
Borré tus foto', ya no quiero verte (¡No!)
Lo mejor que me ha pasado fue perderte (Wu-huh)
Y no, no, no me busques má', no me busques má', que no estoy pa' ti
No, no, no me busques má', no me busques má'
Y si te trato mal (Eh), no e' intencional (No)
Es que por más que tú quieras, no te puedo amar (Na')
Si te trato mal (Eh), no e' intencional
Es que por má' que tú quiera' arreglar

[Letra de ""ODIO""]

[Intro: Bad Bunny]
No quiero saber de ti (No)
No sé qué haces aquí
Ya yo te lo advertí (Yeh, yeh)
Así que, mami, no te me ilusiones
Que pa' ti ya yo no escribo canciones
Lo que digan, me tiene sin cojones
Mala mía, bebé, no te encojones

[Coro: Bad Bunny]
Pero, en realidad, a ti ya yo te odio, odio (Huh)
Pasé de amor al odio (Odio)
Que me perdone Dios, pero te odio (¡Eh!)
¿Que no quiero na' contigo? Eso e' obvio (No, no, no, no, no)
Si quieres, te lo meto, pero será con odio, odio
Pasé de amor al odio (Odio)
Que me perdone Dios, pero te odio (¡Eh!)
¿Que no quiero na' contigo? Eso e' obvio
Si quieres, te lo meto, pero será con odio
(Yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh)

[Verso 1: J Balvin]
Tengo par de vídeos sexuales contigo por ahí (Sí)
Tú no te merece' a nadie el día 'e San Valentín (No, no)
Pa'l carajo con tu novio, quiero que no sea' feliz
Y en la calle se comente lo duro que yo te di (Wuh, wuh, wuh)
La calle y el trabajo (Huh), y los hoteles caros (Okay)
Si yo sabía cuánto ganabas, se me hizo raro (All right, all right)
En un yate en Miami, al otro día en Dubai (Wuh)
No me creas tan pendejo, ya eso e' lo que hay (Hay)
Rencor y remordimiento, sí
Lo tuyo y lo mío se fue con el viento, ey
Ando por ahí con otra, en tu asiento (Sí)
Ayer fuimos a comer y me gasté 500 (Ching!)
Y es por el maldito odio que ahora te tengo (Yeh)
Sí, voy a hacerte un velorio y de ti me vengo
Tranquila, de noche, tú vas a volver (Ajá)
Pidiendo que te lo haga solamente por placer y lo voy a hacer
Pero para que entiendas (Okay?)
Que si tienes tienda es pa' que la atiendas
Te confiaste y te creíste la jodienda (La jodienda)
Pa' ti ya no tengo espacio en mi agenda, baby
No te sorprendas (Wuh, wuh)
Creí que esto valía más que to'a mis prendas
Te confiaste y te creíste la jodienda
Y ahora quisiera perdonarte

[Coro: J Balvin]
Pero, en realidad, a ti ya yo te odio, odio (¿Cómo?)
Pasé de amor al odio
Que me perdone Dios, pero te odio
¿Que no quiero na' contigo? Eso es obvio
Si quieres, te lo meto, pero será con odio, odio
Pasé de amor al odio
Que me perdone Dios, pero te odio
¿Que no quiero na' contigo? Eso es obvio
Si quieres, te lo meto (Pero será con odio)

[Verso 2: Bad Bunny]
Te deseo lo peor (Eh), que tengas mala suerte
Que sufras en la vida y hasta después de la muerte (Eh)
Borré tus foto', ya no quiero verte (¡No!)
Lo mejor que me ha pasado fue perderte (Wu-huh)
Y no, no, no me busques má', no me busques má', que no estoy pa' ti
No, no, no me busques má', no me busques má'
Y si te trato mal (Eh), no e' intencional (No)
Es que por más que tú quieras, no te puedo amar (Na')
Si te trato mal (Eh), no e' intencional
Es que por má' que tú quiera' arreglar

[Coro: Bad Bunny]
Ya yo te odio, odio (Eh)
Pasé de amor al odio (Odio)
Que me perdone Dios, pero te odio (Wuh)
¿Que no quiero na' contigo? Eso e' obvio (Yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh)
Si quieres, te lo meto, pero será con odio, odio
Pasé de amor al odio
Que me perdone Dios, pero te odio
¿Que no quiero na' contigo? Eso e' obvio
Si quieres, te lo meto, pero será con odio, oh (Na')

Mustard on the beat, ho

[Chorus: NAV]
I make shit look easy, but they don't know what it take (Take)
Don't ask me the time, I got baguettes in the face (Bling)
Virgil dropped some Louis, I want everything he made (Made)
When it come to hoes, I never be the one to save
Keep on throwing ones, these bitches keep on showing ass
Bitches on my body and I'm just tryna relax
They always come off cool but in the end they come out wack (Wack)
Her boyfriend getting mad, I told her he could take you back

[Verse 1: NAV]
Have you ever been with a boss?
I know your boyfriend took you shopping at Ross
I'm always dripping, I leave puddles when I walk (Drip)
If she don't know how to dress, I don't wanna talk (No cap)
But I might still get some top
I don't need a belt, my pockets full of knots
Number one, there's finally real ones at the top (At the top)
I'm with Mustard and we talking Lambo' talk (Skrrt, skrrt)

I just pulled up, I got a new bitch (Carti, yeah)
My bitch, she bad, I bought her bracelet
Iced up X on my necklace (On my neck)
I pull up and slatt shit (Slatt, slatt)
I pull up and break shit (I just pull up on 'em)
I just told my mom thank God I made it (I just told my mom)
We got money over here, we starting to pay, bitch (Starting to pay)
I got old school, yeah, in the backyard (Back)
In the black car (Uh), I'm a black boy (Yeah)
What's your net, boy? Huh
Check this neck, boy (Slatt)
Got these black diamonds (Yeah)
On baguettes, boy

Huh, me and your bitch up in the Phantom
If you want her back, you better man up
I know you just don't understand her
She just want you to help her get her bands up
Oh, nah, nah, nah, ayy
Just ride my wave like a tsunami
I came from the jungle, from a safari
I don't want no Nicki, I want a ménage à
Don't give me no hickies, baby, give me sloppy
I already seen you naked, girl, I know your body
You like fucking with the lights off, on some shy shit
You gon' end up being famous if you talk about it

[Verse 1]
Coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine
Gotta gotta be down because I want it all
It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag
Now they're going to bed and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his

[Pre-Chorus]
Chest now, he takes off her dress now
Let me go
I just can't look, it's killing me
And taking control

[Chorus]
Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside

Ayy, Panini, don't you be a meanie
Thought you wanted me to go up
Why you tryna keep me teeny now?
Now they need me, number one on streaming
Oh yeah, you used to love me
So what happened, what's the meaning? I

[Refrain]
I thought you want this for my life, for my life
Said you wanted to see me thrive, you lied

[Verse 3]
Now when it's all done, I get the upper hand
I need a big Benz, not another fan
But I still want you as a fan
I'ma need to sit down, don't mean to make demands
But I need you to...

[Chorus]
Say to me what you want from me
Just say to me what you want from me

Oh, here we go, please let me know

If I spoke on your behalf, then well, you wouldn't know how to talk
If I gave you everything and everything is what I bought
I can take it all back, I never cared 'bout what you thought
I didn't mean to make you mad, I don't like when you upset
I'ma call you later on, baby girl, don't you forget
I'ma take you from this party, we might go and have some sex
Or we do that later on, now we lit like cigarettes

I'm yours and you're mine, I envy

Thought you heard about me, must not, must not
Last nigga did me dirty, dirty
Like a bathroom in a truck stop, truck stop
Now my heart, it feels like Brillo, I'm hard like armadillo
Can't be no nigga ex, I could only be his widow
That's a fact, dressed in black, my heart break, bones will crack
I be chilling, watching Oxygen, my favorite show is Snapped
Now you know how I get, every day, a foreign whip
Rather see you in a hearse than see you with some other bitch

[Pre-Hook: Samra]

Und das Leben ist zu kurz, um nicht zu rauchen

Guck uns an, sieh nur, was aus uns geworden ist
Steig' in den Sportwagen, flüchte bis ins Morgenlicht
Handschellen klicken, doch verrate nie ein'n Bruder
Sitz' besoffen in der Bar, bring Campari-Maracuja! (rrah)
Mann, ich fick' dich eines Tages für die Twitter-Kommentare
Mein Humor all-black, so wie Bitterschokolade
Roll' im Lambo durch Monaco, stapel' Kohle, so wie Fàbregas
Scacchi, Juventus, Jogginghose Adidas
Ich hab' mich tausendmal daneben benomm'n
Und tausendmal sind Mama die Tränen gekomm'n, yeah
Paar Tropfen Tili, seh' den Film an mir vorbeifahr'n
Lieber Gott, ich fühle mich so einsam

Aber Bra, ich steh' dahinter (ja)
Ja, ich hab' gelacht, obwohl ich innerlich gefickt war
Während Rapper unsre Tracks biten (uff), musst' ich im Benz heizen (wrrm)

She find pictures in my e-mail
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good at that shit
See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I always find, yeah, I always find
Yeah I always find something wrong
You been putting up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

[Bridge: Kanye West & Rick James]
Run away from me, baby, ah, run away
Run away from me, baby
(Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya)
Run away
When it starts to get crazy
(Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya)
Then, run away
Babe, I got a plan, run away as fast as you can
Run away from me, baby, run away
Run away from me, baby
(Look at-look at-look at-look at-look at-look at-look at ya)
Run away
When it starts to get crazy
(Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya, look at ya)
Why can't she just, run away?
Baby, I got a plan, run away as fast as you can

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
24/7, 365, pussy stays on my mind
I-I-I-I did it, alright, alright, I admit it
Now pick your next move, you could leave or live wit' it
Ichabod Crane with that motherfucking top off
Split and go where? Back to wearing knockoffs, haha
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the balla-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless, P!

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you are at an advantage
Cause you can blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'ma manage
If one day you just up and leave

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I always find, yeah, I always find something wrong
You been putting up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags

Did I really just forget that melody?
Naw, na, na, banananananana
Alright, dada dadadada

[Chorus: bbno$]
When I popped off, then your girl gave me just a little bit of lockjaw
Baby so cold, he from the north, he from the Canada
Bankroll so low, I got nothing else that I can withdraw
Ran out the door
I shine my wrist, it go like shashasha, shashasha
I got your bitch singing like lalala, lalala
I shine my wrist, it go like shashasha, shashasha
I got your bitch singing like lalala, lalala
How I stride like that

[Verse 1: bbno$]
Amex, no cap, eight hundred score
They wonder how, how I guap like that
I rap my lyrics when I perform
They wonder how, how I stride like that
Married to the grind, I brought my ring
I'm corny, but your girly want the dick
Modest with my jewels, but check the bank
Finally got the money, say my thanks

Got the paper, went to school

They call me Megatron, just did a telethon
He got Margielas on, and I get my jealous on
I fuck him like I miss him, he just came out of prison
Bitches be talkin' shit, but they ain't got a pot to piss in
My name is Nicki M, I'm in a sticky Benz
That mean it's candy apple red, I'm Barbie, this is Ken
That is a Fendi fact, I'm with a hunnid macs
Oh, this is custom made, Donatella sent me that

Feel up, baby, feel on me

I put the squeeze on him, th-throw up the Bs on him
Th-that ass clappin' on the D, Hercules on him
My name is baddie, baddie, I keep it tight for zaddy
He keep it comin', comin', he ain't even drop the Addy
Trunk in the front-front, I need a blunt-blunt
I own my own moscato, bitch, we gettin' drunk-drunk

Oh honey, just tell me what you want me to
Oh honey, kiss me up against the wall
Oh honey, don't take anything, just have it all

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I can take it, so don't you fake it
I know your love's my destiny
Yeah, I can take it, please demonstrate it
'Cause I'm going down in history

[Chorus]
Hey, yeah, whoa-ho, I'm on a roll
Ridin' so high, achieving my goals
Hey, yeah, whoa-ho, I'm on a roll
Ridin' so high, achieving my goals

[Post-Chorus]
I'm stoked on ambition and verve
I'm gonna get what I deserve
So full of ambition and verve
I'm gonna get what I deserve

[Verse 2]
Oh honey, let's get in through the door
Oh honey, not concerned who sees us ripping up the floor
Oh honey, we'll go dancing wherever you choose
Oh honey, you know we just can't lose

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I can take it, so don't you fake it
I know your love's my destiny
Yeah, I can take it, please demonstrate it
'Cause I'm going down in history

[Intro]
Hypnotize Mafia

[Part 1: Dardan]
Schreibe paar Zeilen und ficke den Markt
Neun Millimeter, schicke dir dein Ticket ins Grab (pow, pow, pow, pow)
Mister Dardy im Porsche Spyder
F-Type, S-Line, Digga, oder Maybach (rrah)
Streck' Weiß, test' Lines, mach' die Kohle einfach
Ficke gleich dein'n Hype, du kleiner Hosenscheißer (rrah)
Mach bitte nicht auf extravagant
Bester im Land, kiffe mein Mexican Skunk (bow, bow)
Motherfucker, lade meine Chesterfield dann (rrah)
Komme in der Festival an (pow, pow, pow, pow)
Überrolle diese Penner wie ein Panzer, esperanza
Tanzt grad und möchte meinen Schwanz ganz hart in die Tachna haben (ah)
Immer noch fly wie'n Rastafari (fly)
Immer noch bleib' ich Mister Dardy (Dardy)
Rede nicht so viel, du machst eh nix wie DJ Khaled (DJ Khaled)
Komm' im Trainingsanzug in dein Café und schieß' auf alle (rrah)
Komm zu Hypnotize, komm, komm
Drücke dir meine Baretta in die Fresse (*Schüsse*, pow-pow)
Mach kein Palaver, ich kenn' kein Pardon
Digga, fick nicht mit Dardan, du kommst nicht davon (niemals)
Ah, Sippi, mache Para á la Bill Gates (Bill Gates)
Ich mach' den Scheiß für die Familie, Digga, fick Fame!

[Hook: Dardan, Eno]
Ah, Sippi, sagt mir, wer macht Para á la Maradona? (Maradona)
Früher noch mit Steinen und ei'm Wasserkocher (Wasserkocher)
Sagt mir, wer macht Para á la Maradona? (Maradona)
Heute schmeckt das Leben süß, so wie Panna cotta (Panna cotta, brra)
Stapel' Es, Bares zähl'n, sagt mir, wer macht Para?
Mercedes das Emblem, sagt mir, wer macht Para?
Stapel' Es, Bares zähl'n, sagt mir, wer macht Para?
Sagt mir, wer macht Para? Sagt mir, sagt mir, wer macht Para?

[Part 2: Eno]
Schreibe paar Zeilen, ch-pfuh auf wen du kennst
Zähl' die Scheine in der Hilton-Residenz
Am Tag zehn Mille
Lebe die Scarface-Filme der geflüchteten Cousins (ra-ta-ta-ta)
Stapel' die Bündel, die Scharfe am Gürtel
Sie macht *klick* *klick*, du rennst
Xmerta im Würgegriff, hacke es, stückel' es
Auch wenn es Sünde ist, es muss weg (wouh, wouh, wouh)
Kauf' für Mama eine vollbesetzte AP, AP (AP, AP, AP)
Akhi, wer macht Para? Wer macht Flous? Wer macht Money, Money?
Kafa lesh, c'est la vie
Heh, zu viel Energie
Yapma mit der Crew aus NRW
Auf der Jagd nach Flous, ya salame (rrah)
Immer noch so hungrig, ja, Mann
Ficke deine Mutter wie dein Vater
Ein Wort reicht und du landest im Kofferraum von den Cardas
Auf Blind-Date mit den Kangals, allez, allez
Lass mal dein Gestotter
Drei glatte Stiche durch dein'n Jogger
Danach über Elazığ nach Yüksekova
Flüchten in 'nem Helikopter
Der Flex-Push am Flixbus-Bahnhof
Versteckt in Hähnchenbrust wie Gustavo (wouh, wouh)
Mache Es, so viel es geht
Kein Platz mehr im Schuhkarton
Ah, Sippi, sagt mir, wer macht Para á la Mayweather?
Meine Taschen platzen, frag Dardan, ja, der Bre kennt das

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
Watch me take a good thing and fuck it all up in one night
Catch me, I'm the one on the run away from the headlights
No sleep, up all week, wasting time with people I don't like
I think something's fucking wrong with me

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Drown myself in alcohol, that shit never helps at all
I might say some stupid things tonight when you pick up this call
I've been hearing silence on the other side for way too long
I can taste it on my tongue, I can tell that something's wrong, but
I guess it's just my life and I can take it if I wanna
But I cannot hide in hills of California
Because these hills have eyes, and I got paranoia
I hurt myself sometimes, is that too scary for you?

Roll me up and smoke me, love
And we can fly into the night
Roll me up and smoke me, love
And we can fly into the night
You take drugs (Take drugs) to let go (Let go)
And figure it all out on your own
Take drugs (Take drugs) on gravestones (Gravestones)

Cook that shit up, Quay
Lil Baby
I've been riding around, yeah, hundred times around

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I been riding 'round in rental cars, tryna lay low
I'm a real soldier, boy, I really play with Dracos
Took the whole gang from out the hood and put 'em on the payroll
Having flashbacks of hittin' the red with the Karo
She just had a baby for me, so I paid to get her makeover
I was being calm, it's like it's they beg for me to take over
180 on the Range Rover, 400 on a Rolls truck (Wow)
300 on a G-Wagen (Wow), I'm a big dawg, you can add it up
Something wrong with him, he ain't addin' up
We laugh at them, they mad at us
It's a home run, I'm batter up
My earrings like baseballs
Clout chasers, I hate y'all
I don't see people like Ray Charles
Where I'm from, we don't do fraud
You a kingpin or a takegod?

I just bought a bustdown, can't wait to hold it up
All these Percs won't stay down, I keep on throwing up
Youngin ain't gon' play with him, he did it off of love (Yeah)

I just bought a bustdown, can't wait to hold it up (Yeah)

Who you know, nigga? Street niggas call me Pluto
Really I'm a trap nigga, I can wrap a kilo (Yeah)
Sippin' sizzurp took me number one, no promo (Oh yeah)
I'm in spaceships, I'm in Mars on the low-low (Yeah, yeah)
I'm in the Phantom with the stars, feel like Fabo (Yeah)
I got million dollar stars on my payroll, huh
I feel like you different once you make it out the mud
Got a brand new Richard, I can't wait to hold it up
VV, cut it up, got all new baguettes in it, cut it up (Ooh)
One, brrt, call, that's all, brrt, pu-pullin' up (Ooh)
This bag make a bad, bad bitch call up and quit her job (Yeah)

[Intro: Future]
Cook that shit up, Quay
Lil Baby
I've been riding around, yeah, hundred times around

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I been riding 'round in rental cars, tryna lay low
I'm a real soldier, boy, I really play with Dracos
Took the whole gang from out the hood and put 'em on the payroll
Having flashbacks of hittin' the red with the Karo
She just had a baby for me, so I paid to get her makeover
I was being calm, it's like it's they beg for me to take over
180 on the Range Rover, 400 on a Rolls truck (Wow)
300 on a G-Wagen (Wow), I'm a big dawg, you can add it up
Something wrong with him, he ain't addin' up
We laugh at them, they mad at us
It's a home run, I'm batter up
My earrings like baseballs
Clout chasers, I hate y'all
I don't see people like Ray Charles
Where I'm from, we don't do fraud
You a kingpin or a takegod?

[Chorus: Lil Baby & Future]
I just bought a bustdown, can't wait to hold it up
All these Percs won't stay down, I keep on throwing up
Youngin ain't gon' play with him, he did it off of love (Yeah)
I feel like it's different when you got it out the mud
I just bought a bustdown, can't wait to hold it up (Yeah)
All these Percs won't stay down, I keep on throwing up (Yeah)
Youngin ain't gon' play with him, he did it off of love (Racks)
I feel like it's different when you got it out the mud

[Verse 2: Future]
Who you know, nigga? Street niggas call me Pluto
Really I'm a trap nigga, I can wrap a kilo (Yeah)
Sippin' sizzurp took me number one, no promo (Oh yeah)
I'm in spaceships, I'm in Mars on the low-low (Yeah, yeah)
I'm in the Phantom with the stars, feel like Fabo (Yeah)
I got million dollar stars on my payroll, huh
I feel like you different once you make it out the mud
Got a brand new Richard, I can't wait to hold it up
VV, cut it up, got all new baguettes in it, cut it up (Ooh)
One, brrt, call, that's all, brrt, pu-pullin' up (Ooh)
This bag make a bad, bad bitch call up and quit her job (Yeah)
Where I'm from you either gotta murder, if you make it out, you a god

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I just bought a bustdown, can't wait to hold it up
All these Percs won't stay down, I keep on throwing up
Youngin ain't gon' play with him, he did it off of love (Yeah)
I feel like it's different when you got it out the mud
I just bought a bustdown, can't wait to hold it up (Yeah)
All these Percs won't stay down, I keep on throwing up (Yeah)
Youngin ain't gon' play with him, he did it off of love
I feel like it's different when you got it out the mud

[Intro: Anuel AA]
Yo siempre me pregunto por qué tú no está' aquí (Está' aquí)
Y soy un infeliz desde que te perdí (Te perdí)
Tú tiene' lo que me enloquece a mí
Y desde que te fuiste, por dentro morí (Morí)
Y el tiempo nunca da pa' atrá' (No da pa' atrá')
Y si viene' hoy, mañana mismo tú te va' (Te va')
Baby, que novedá', yo no creo en la casualidá' (Oh-oh-oh)

Y si no te tengo, esto se pone intenso (Intenso)
Y e' un suspenso siempre que te pienso (Te pienso)
Tú ere' mala, mala, mala, eh, eh
Tú no ama', ama', ama', no, no (No, no, no)

[Verso 1: Anuel AA]
Baby, dame la lu' (Lu'), baby, dame la lu' (Lu')
Tú no quiere' amor, -mor, y eso lo sabes tú (Tú)
Baby, tú siempre me confunde'
Y en la soledá', tú a mí me hunde' (Hunde')
Y ya yo no te quiero amar, no (No), quiero darte calor, sí
Yo me dejo llevar, ya siempre va a ser así
Y no se vale, vale, vale (Vale)
Tú 'tá llena 'e male', male', males (Male')

[Verso 2: Karol G]
Y te domino cuando te hablo cosa' sucia' en el oído
Y encima de ti gritando que tú eres mío (Eres mío)
Y yo sé que bien rico la pasas conmigo (Ey, oh)
Y dime tú qué vamo' a hacer (Ey)
Un día me quieres pero al otro no sabes qué hacer (Ey)
Te gusta verme para luego desaparecer
¿Cuál es el truco? Dímelo, bebé (-melo, bebé)
Quieres jugar pero vas a perder
Y te domino cuando te hablo cosa' sucia' en el oído (Te domino; oído)
Y encima de ti gritando que tú eres mío
Y yo sé que bien rico la pasas conmigo
Baby, te necesito

[Verso 3: Arcángel]
(Yao', Austin, baby)
Sólo espero que no te arrepientas
Para mí tú eres tremenda infeliz (Yes)
Tu tiempo pasó y no te diste cuenta (Bye)
Ahora te toca verme feliz sin ti (Okay)
Como quisiera que bien te fuera (Yao'; yes)
Para que vieras como curo mi corazón (Ajá)
Tú sabe' como yo nadie te amaba (Baby)
Amaneciendo contigo me curaba, yeh
Pasó el tiempo y todo parece que fue ayer (Fue ayer)
Acariciaba tu piel con criterio (Con criterio), yeh
Aunque no fui yo el que te hizo mujer
Fui el má' que te pudo encender, eso era en serio (¡Auh!), yeh

[Verse 1]
I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

[Chorus]
I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

[Verse 2]
I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me too
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do

Take my hand, we'll be fine

Have to do this alone
Promise I'll never let you down

And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how

[Pre-Chorus 1]
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well me, I fall in love with you every single day
I just wanna tell you I am

[Chorus]
So honey, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

[Verse 2]
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how

[Pre-Chorus 2]
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, ""Hey, are you okay?""

[Pre-Chorus]
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)

You need to calm down

[Verse 2]
You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night

You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay

Sagen, „Gib auf!“, aber ich mach's nicht
Fick dein'n Swag, fick dein Amerikanisch (ah)
Im Ghetto zu leben nicht einfach
Der Maybach bringt gar nix, weil ich keine Zeit hab'
Ja, tamam, meine Roli ist am glänzen
Was bringt mir das? Sehe meine Mutter selten
Sesimi verdim sokaklara
Olabilir her şey, bak olanlara
Beni yoranlara cevabım bu şarkı
Ha, bu da Mero'nun farkı

[Pre-Hook]
Bedelini ödedik içimiz (yana) yana (yana), yana (yana)
Yana (yana), yana, yana, yana
Bile bile bırakır adamı kana (kana), kana (kana)
Kana (kana, ah!), Mero vurur yine damara (ah!)

[Hook]
Bana, sana, bize bi' şey olabilir
Sebebini biliyorum, beni yorabilir
Kafama gelen soruyu bana sorabilir (ahh)
(Ah!) Bana, sana, bize bi' şey olabilir
Sebebini biliyorum, beni yorabilir
Kafama gelen soruyu bana sorabilir (ahh)

[Verse]
Look at my history
I'm tryna see what's different from that guy and the richer me
The only thing I see is custom owls from Tiffany
And some gunnas that'll hit you outta nowhere like epiphany
Really, that's it to me
Aside from the obvious, man, it changes in scenery
Testin' me gon' have my niggas testin' machinery
They say that they happy, my man, that's not how they seem to be
The boy, he wild and peaceful, rest in peace Teena Marie
Ethics and values, mob traditions, old fashioned
Monopoly action
Bronny buyin' up Brentwood like he still in Akron
A lot of pain, a lot of passion
A lot of relaxin' while other niggas is overreactin'
That's how we continue down the path of Jordan and Jackson
That's some insight for y'all even if no one's askin'
Last year, niggas really feel like they rode on me
Last year, niggas got hot 'cause they told on me
I'm 'bout to call the bluff of anybody that fold on me
I'm buyin' the buildin' of every door that closed on me
Yeah, Loro Piana and Brioni, the one and only
Champagne popper, the love doctor
Your baby mother call me when she lonely
My tailor see me twice a week, he like my homie
Forever grateful, forever thankful
Diamond necklace, but she wears it on her ankle
The bitch is trendy
My enemies send each other the texts that they could never send me
I'm bankin' two million a show for the residency
Nevada gaming commission in a frenzy
How much money can this casino lend me?
Rippin' markers up over shots of the Henny
Vivid memory, can someone send me a real nigga interlude?
To me, Benihana is pigeon food
This not a forgivin' mood
So much, we gotta count the 20s up in a different room
I am just a body that my brothers are livin' through
Keepin' my connections strictly physical
Everyone that's married is miserable
I know that that is not a lifestyle I can give into
The rise to the top of this mountain has been biblical
I don't carry cash 'cause the money is digital
It's the American Expresser, the debt collector
Hailin' all the way from the Mecca
Got something for Trudy and Rebecca
This shit could last forever
The mind controller, the Ayatollah
I built a bridge to success and had visions of me ridin' over
Step in the room and October gets a lot closer
Haunted houses
I don't know how to count in thousands, only millions
Now tell your friends I'm not the villain
Send 'em to Lagos or Turks and Caicos
Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago
Never go the same places they go
Separate vacations
A far cry from when Drizzy had slept in the basement
I was never on the path to get into Cambridge
I mean, I was good at doin' math, but I'm better with language
Borderline dangerous, approach with caution
I plan to buy your most personal belongings when they up for auction
Man, truth be told, I think about it often
The petty king, the overseer of many things
I wish that I was playin' in a sport where we were gettin' rings
I wouldn't have space on either hand for anything
West Hollywood, know my presence is menacing
Cosa Nostra, shady dealings
Racketeering, the syndicate got they hand in plenty things
The things that we've done to protect the name are unsettling
But no regrets, though, the name'll echo
Years later, none greater
Death to a coward and a traitor, that's just in my nature, yeah

Und die Uhren voller Steine, es läuft von alleine

Bleib' einen Monat in Beverly (brr)
Hab' eine Molly im Hennessy (nein)
Wir sind am ballen in Malibu (Gang, Gang)

Ich will es seh'n, wer noch Welle schiebt (uh-uh)

[Intro: Future]
Hitmaka
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Don’t owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me ‘lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like a edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I’m enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane
(Thank you, God, God bless you, thank you so much)

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don’t act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen courtrooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I’m takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Outro: Kanye West & Big Sean]
Bounce back, bounce, bounce
Bounce back, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bitch, bounce (Yeah)
Is you a real one?
Is you a real one?
Real one
Real one
Is you a real one?

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Don’t owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me ‘lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like a edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I’m enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane
(Thank you, God, God bless you, thank you so much)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don’t act but I'll act up

Back, back, back, back up

You know what to do to pull me into you
’Cause every time you move, you take my breath, breath, breath away

And when I hear you, oh
Suddenly off my feet
So will you come through? Oh
And I'll play you on repeat, ooh

You got the perfect words to hurt me so, hurt me so good
You’re singing a sad song, but you make it sound happy
You're playing my heart and I'm falling apart just like I knew I would

And everything you say, I memori-i-ize it all

[Verse 1]
There's somethin' in the way you roll your eyes
Takes me back to a better time
When I saw everything is good
But now you're the only thing that's good
Tryna stand up on my own two feet
This conversation ain't coming easily
And darlin', I know it's getting late
So what do you say we leave this place?

[Chorus]
Walk me home in the dead of night
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind, mhm
So say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong goin' on outside

[Verse 2]
There's somethin' in the way I wanna cry
That makes me think we'll make it out alive
So come on and show me how we're good
I think that we could do some good, mhm

Walk me home in the dead of night
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind, mhm

[Verse 1: David Paich]
I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
Her moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become

Everybody's talkin' 'bout heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this (heaven)
Could be better than this (heaven, heaven)

[Outro]
I swear this is perfect
Come kiss me one more time

It’s closing time, so leave with me again (Yeah)
You got all my love to spend, oh
Let's find a place where happiness begins

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas]
We gon' dance in my living room, slave to the way you move
Hurts when I’m leaving you (Ayy)
Just dance in the living room, love with an attitude
Drunk to an '80s groove (Ayy)
We gon' dance in my living room, slave to the way you move
Hurts when I'm leaving you (Ayy)
Dance in the living room, love with an attitude
Drunk

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
It's only human, you know that it's real
So why would you fight or try to deny the way that you feel?
Oh, babe, you can't fool me, your body's got other plans
So stop pretending you’re shy, just come on and
Dance, dance, dance, dance, oh

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]

I’m praying you don't change your mind

PK
Mixer T, cì

[Strofa 1: Gemitaiz]
È il Gemitaiz te rispondo ancora che voi?
Cambio l’attacco che siamo arrivati alla settima
Con M, siamo come quella bibita energetica
C'avessi i capelli, c'avrei una tipa che mi pettina
Se giro questa lei che mi molesta
Frate’, poi piscio in testa a chi ci contesta
Queste tipe perfette sono la ricompensa
La bocca si muove da sola e va tipo Tesla

Sì, davvero, è Veleno 7

Faccio ancora merda che ti sorprende
Mi dispiace, giuro, per chi non comprende
Sono cold temper ma lascio queste tipe contente
Poi mi schianto al suolo, John Denver
Sto in alto dove il cell non prende
Tu stai in basso, il tuo studio sembra un call center
È inutile che piangi, il tuo disco non vende
Neanche se ci alleghi un bel viaggio in Medio Oriente
Se faccio il rap è fatto bene, frate’, cazzo mene
Di questo che parla dei miei concerti e poi manco viene
Sono un bracconiere, se voglio rappo un mese, fra’, e le rappo tese
La tua tipa si piega in avanti e non è giapponese
Giù con Emme, baby, sputo gemme, non vi rubo niente
Vinco sempre, ho tutte le risposte come il Google Center
Siamo due leggende, fumo come Snoop, bevo come Bender
Torno in auto blu oppure con le bende
Sì, qualcuno qua c’ha precedenti
Certo che non li leggo, frate’, quei commenti
Siamo egocentrici, almeno sentici
Se no prenditi male e poi genuflettiti ai due flow epici
Sale quando non te lo aspetti
Tipo dei medicinali o degli anestetici
Tu puoi centellinare ma mi sa che smetti
Tipo come se entri in mare e nelle tasche hai i pesi, suonate pessimi
(Faggots)
Alle feste apro le teste
Essere o non essere, ho una bomba che è un Winchester
Cento colpi e ti investe, non ci fare richieste
Guardaci diventare bestie dopo una cena di pesce
Uh, mamma mia, quasi duecento in galleria
Di paranoia ho già la mia e danza come una ballerina
Fresco come la Valtellina
Corro più veloce, prendo la bandierina

[Strofa 2: MadMan]
(Emme)
Le tecniche che cerchi, fai scouting
Fumo e faccio i cerchi dell’Audi
Drowning, Cali smoking con Davi
In polo Navy da quando sti cazzo di album li coloravi
Mezza Italia rappa, trappa, ma non sono bravi
Li lasciamo nella merda con i loro pari
Non provare a ricopiarmi che fai solo danni
Morirò e farò i contanti con i miei ologrammi

(Oh no, ci risiamo)
Versi top, zì, ce ne ho troppi
Belli ghiotti, Pernigotti
Nel cappello e nei cappotti, Mary Poppins
Sul carello coi biscotti, con i pizzoccheri
Vedi un picco degli ascolti, divento serio
Prenoto un volo in due secondi, duemila euro
Fai la fattura e poi ti scordi, controlla i soldi
Pensa al dinero, ti ricordi come vivevo?

Spacco giusto un pochino poi scappo giù col bottino
Dal cazzo di condominio, ti mangio, ti cuocio vivo
Non stacco, c’ho il flow continuo, compatto lo sai che scrivo
Cattivo vampiro con il canino lo affilo
Vedi un puntino sei a tiro
Ti uccido perché ti miro
Non troppo in alto né in basso, tipo all’altezza del busto
Mi fotte un cazzo, sono pazzo, Frank Castle, Billy Russo
Quindi molto meglio se mi miri giusto

Occhio a come ti comporti, siamo forti
Suono il flow tipo gli accordi, pianoforti
Di goal ne facciamo troppi, tipo Totti
Igor Protti, morti, rigor mortis
Sempre sia lodato M per sti rappers
Sempre sia lodato il verde che ci serve
Con Gem lo sai che siamo frecce
Da quando volevamo solo emergere
Ad ora che dettiamo legge

Sto con una tipa da tachicardia
Pensa ogni mattina che fatica questa vita mia
Non lo so la svolta quanto dura, la mia è una mania
Spacco solo troppo, non c’è cura a questa malattia
M può fottersene
Il mio flow te le promette, frate’, è Viggo Mortensen
È Kevin Costner con un canne mozze
Prova a fottermi, mi inviti a nozze
(Emme)

(Oh, oh; Hydro; Ozuna; oh, oh)

[Refrán]
Ten valor de decir (Valor de decir)
Que no quiere' seguir
Si intentar no es el plan (Intentar no es el plan)
Entonces, ya te perdí
Extrañaré tus besos
Sé que cada uno fue genuino (Woh, oh; fue genuino)
Mi amor fue real
Pero al final siempre lo arruino (Siempre lo arruino)
No puedo detenerte

Ten valor de decir (Valor de decir)
Que no quiere' seguir
Si intentar no es el plan (Intentar no es el plan)
Entonces, ya te perdí
Extrañaré tus besos
Sé que cada uno fue genuino (Oh-oh; fue genuino)

No puedo detenerte

[Verse 1: Vargas & Agnes]
Weight is on me, weight is on you
We scream and we fight like there's nothing to lose
End of the day, come and take my all
There’s no place I'd rather be than in your arms
Weight is on you, weight is on me
Sometimes I'm not who you want me to be
God knows I try, we stumble and we fall
There’s no place I'd rather be than in your arms

Your tough love is what I discern
Sweet tough love, you're my pretty good luck charm
There's no place I'd rather be than in your arms

T'as un compte certifié mais t'as pas de follower, tricheur (Dems)
Les maisons de disques sont des salopes, c'pour ça qu'elles font des avances
J'f'rai pas deux fois la même erreur
Donne-moi ton cœur que j'écrase mon mégot, c'est à toi que je parle donc fais pas ton De Niro
J'ai pris des grammes et j'ai perdu des kilos, t'assumes pas ta calvitie comme Ne-Yo
Ça fait trop d'weed pour une seule beuh, ça fait trop d'bitches pour une seule queue
Ça fait trop d'morts pour une seule vie, ça fait trop d'torts pour une seule fille
J'suis dans l'bendo, renfermé sur moi, j'te salue pas, j'suis pas courtois
Loin des malfrats et des bourgeois, entre vie et mort sur l'accoudoir
J'entends ""sale nègre"", ah ouais ? J'me tourne sec, Glock : boum, boum, bang, bang
Tous les jours à être dans main event, grand, noir et dur comme un bois d'ébène
Trop de chagrin à l'intérieur, j'ai connu la guerre et la frayeur

Bientôt, j'arrête tout ça, mama, t'en fais pas pour mon avenir (ouais)
Bientôt, je change de vie (eh), demain, je change de ville

[Couplet 2 : Nekfeu & Damso]
Mes copines me taquinent ""voilà l'acteur"", ma richesse intérieure dans mon laptop
Mama s'inquiète pour mes frères, elle nous a vu grandir ensemble et certains finir locked up
Que des cobayes sur une piste étroite, j'ai grandi pareil
La première fois qu'ils te lisent tes droits, c'est quand ils t'arrêtent (c'est quand ils t'arrêtent, ouais)
Notre succès, c'est pour tous les fils de putes de vigiles qui nous ont mal regardés
Et quand j'étais petit, j'avoue, j'étais parfois jaloux des enfants que maman gardait
Ceux qui sont v'nus soulever les meubles, c'était pas les déménageurs
Séparation des ménages avant que l'enfant devienne un jeune
Mouss a passé quatre ans au placard, pour lui, c'était ça d'être majeur
Et tes rappeurs, ils parlent de quoi ? C'est des beaufs, c'est des maîtres-nageurs
Bruxelles, Paname, la pépinière, tu crois qu'on est là depuis hier ?
Tu parles à fond, tu bibi r, toujours au front comme baby hair
Mama, j'étais sous gasolina, mama, j'étais sous gasolina
Mais je veux être un gars solide, je veux pas voir mes gars sous lean, non, non, non
Ça m'inquiète, on sait pas qui t'es, on enquête
Compte certifié mais personne te connaît, t'as pas le droit de tweeter en anglais, (tricheur)
Le succès, c'est un moyen d'avoir des plaves et mes gavas, ils pourraient te vendre une loc' (vroum, vroum)
Sur les traîtres, une main dans les fesses, les keufs les font parler comme des ventriloques
J's'rai plus l'ami d'un lascar faible, la sœur de mon frère, c'est ma sœur
Chez nous, y a pas de sale manie comme dans Scarface

[Pont 2 : Damso]
J'suis dans l'break neck, j'suis trop high, mec, il m'faut une shneck sèche, de tieks bien fraîche
Que j'baise express, un gros cul d'braise, j'évacue stress et lot d'tristesse
Il m'faut un wellness que j'décompresse, j'suis dans trop d'fesses, faut qu'j'me confesse
J'suis dans l'business, besoin d'vitesse, j'suis dans l'ivresse, maman, God bless me

[Refrain : Nekfeu & Damso]

T'as un compte certifié mais t'as pas de follower, tricheur (Dems)
Les maisons de disques sont des salopes, c'pour ça qu'elles font des avances
J'f'rai pas deux fois la même erreur
Donne-moi ton cœur que j'écrase mon mégot, c'est à toi que je parle donc fais pas ton De Niro
J'ai pris des grammes et j'ai perdu des kilos, t'assumes pas ta calvitie comme Ne-Yo
Ça fait trop d'weed pour une seule beuh, ça fait trop d'bitches pour une seule queue
Ça fait trop d'morts pour une seule vie, ça fait trop d'torts pour une seule fille
J'suis dans l'bendo, renfermé sur moi, j'te salue pas, j'suis pas courtois
Loin des malfrats et des bourgeois, entre vie et mort sur l'accoudoir
J'entends ""sale nègre"", ah ouais ? J'me tourne sec, Glock : boum, boum, bang, bang
Tous les jours à être dans main event, grand, noir et dur comme un bois d'ébène
Trop de chagrin à l'intérieur, j'ai connu la guerre et la frayeur
Rupture de l'hymen, elle m'fait de la peine, j'l'ai même pas baisée que j'l'ai déjà, Ken

[Intro: Nick Jonas]
I'm feeling so cool
From top to the bottom, just cool
Every little thing that I do
Well, dammit, I'm feelin' so cool, yeah

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Woke up feelin' like a new James Dean
I comb my hair like an old school scene
I'm feelin' high like a late night summer of last year (Yeah)
Standin' there with the red dress on ya
A Killer Queen like a young Jane Fonda
Is it me or am I just havin' a good year?

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Lately, I've been feelin' so cool (Cool)
Top to the bottom, just cool (Cool)
Every little thing that I do (Do)
Dammit, I'm feelin' so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool
It's like, ooh (Ooh), maybe I should bottle my moves (Moves)
Sell 'em for a dollar or two (Two)
Dammit, I'm feeling so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool (Cool)

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
Must've done something right 'cause all these
Lights are green, man, they look like palm trees
And every time that song comes on it's about me
Oh, I feel like Post Malone when I get home
Sittin' there, winning like it's Game of Thrones
And now that we've made it, how complicated was last year?

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Lately, I've been feelin' so cool (Cool)
Top to the bottom, just cool (Cool)
Every little thing that I do (Do)
Dammit, I'm feelin' so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool
It's like, ooh (Ooh), maybe I should bottle my moves (Moves)
Sell 'em for a dollar or two (Two)
'Cause dammit, I'm feeling so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool (Cool)

[Bridge: Nick Jonas]
Woke up feelin' like a new James Dean
I comb my hair like an old school scene
When I grow up, I wanna be just like me

[Chorus: Jonas Brothers]
Lately, I've been feelin' so cool (Cool)
Top to the bottom, just cool (Cool)
Every little thing that I do (Do)
Dammit, I'm feelin' so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool

Just getting lost out at sea
Can you see my emotion
Say, can you see my devotion?

Just getting lost out at sea

I hear what you're saying, I got a bad reputation
And now you got me praying for a better situation

Drifting out into nothing

Every night, every day, how about every lifetime?
Yeah, I know what they say, and that's fine
'Cause I'm here to stay through the good and the bad times
Baby, save me a space in your mind, yeah

Zählen nur Patte, Patte Lila
Holen die Patte, Patte wieder
Ich trag' Marken, La Martina
Durch die Straßen mit 'ner Chivas
Geb' ihn'n Haze, Baba-Weed, Bra
Rasen Mitternacht durch Straßen, viva la puta
Ticke meine Ware frisch wie'n Kolumbianer
Lass mal deine Filme, Kurdisch ist die Ader
Baba-Haze ballert wieder mal, wieder mal bam-bam
Hörst du meine Stimme? Ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta, Pumpgun
Trage jeden Tag die Filme wie Tony Montana
Baller' wie 'ne Automatiker-Uzi aus Ghana

I'm losing my self control
Yeah, you’re starting to trickle back in
But I don't wanna fall down the rabbit hole
Cross my heart, I won't do it again

[Pre-Chorus]
I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, ""Draw the line""
And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
And I think of you

[Chorus]
Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it’s never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over

[Post-Chorus]
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

And if I think it over, maybe you’ll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

Se acostó temprano, mañana hay que estudiar, eh
Pero llamó a la amiga diciendo pa' janguear (Jeje), eh
Tiene un culito ahí que le acabo de textear, eh (Jah)
Pero en Bajita, ella no e' de frontear (Ey, ey)

Es panita (Wuh), del que vende (Eh), ey
Nena mala de repente (Prr-prr)

But they don't have a shot when I compare them to you
It's too late, too late
Baby, I know I'll never find you again
Find you again

[Verse 1: Camila Cabello]
Baby, baby, I
Walk in the late night
Looking for your eyes
Put up a fight to find you
Lose it every time
You were the last of your kind
All of the blame's mine

[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello]
And I remember you told me
That we could work it all out, don't you worry
And now the tears in your eyes make it blurry
But if you say try again, I'd be ready
I'm ready, yeah

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
I'll try to pass the night away with somebody new
But they don't have a shot when I compare them to you
It's too late, too late
Baby, I know I'll never find you again
Find you again

[Verse 2: Camila Cabello]
Have mercy on me, please
I messed up to the third degree
This crush is kind of crushing me
I do therapy at least twice a week
There's a you-shaped space in my bed
Always you-shaped thoughts inside my head, like
I keep wishing I'd run into you
La Cienega, where I remember you

[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello]
And I remember you told me (Told me)
That we could work it all out, don't you worry (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And now the tears in your eyes make it blurry
But if you say try again, I'd be ready
I'm ready

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
I'll try to pass the night away with somebody new
But they don't have a shot when I compare them to you
It's too late, too late
Baby, I know I'll never find you again

[Bridge: Camila Cabello]
Find you again
Find you again
Find you again
Find you again
Find you again (It's too late)
Find you again (It's too late)
Find you again (It's too late)
Find you again (It's too late)

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
I'll try to pass the night away with somebody new (Find you again)
But they don't have a shot when I compare them to you (Find you again)
It's too late, too late
Baby, I know I'll never find you again
Find you again

She be talking that shit, talkin' out of her neck (Brr)
Put blood on her dress (Woo)
Bitches be mad when they see Cardi step in the spot (Woah)
Said that you 'bout it, we know that you not
I'ma pull up on bitches as soon as I drop
Bought a new foreign, I might cop a yacht (Skrrt)
Bitches in my business, they tryna plot (Woo)
Hoes poppin' shit like they hot but they not (No)
Just flooded the wrist, the Patek, the watch (Woah)
Niggas be flexing, we know what you got
Cardi done had got the game in a knot
Fuckin' your nigga, I got him on lock

VVS chain, I'm in love with the rocks (Woah)
You said you gon' take it, bitch, you got me chopped (Woah)

Tell that bitch to pull up, I'ma send you the drop

[Chorus]
Press, press, press, press, press

Pop up, guess who, bitch?

Pussy still wet like Florida (Woo)
Everyone drop on the floor

This chopper come straight from Dior
Done with the talkin', I'm open to violence
Ask anybody, they know I'm about it
Hashtag whip that ho ass
Fuck around, we gon' start a new challenge (Woo)
I come in this bitch and I'm strapped up and ready
Ridin' that dick like I'm Cardi Andretti
Fuck at your crib, we don't go to no 'telly
I sit on his face whenever I'm ready (Woo)

[Verse]
""Hey, Nate, how's life?""
I don’t know, it's alright
I've been dealin’ with some things like every human being
And really didn't sleep much last night
""I'm sorry,"" that's fine
I just think I need a little me time
I just think I need a little free time
Little break from the shows and the bus rides, yeah
Last year I had a breakdown
Thoughts tellin' me I'm lost gettin' too loud
Had to see a therapist, then I found out
Somethin' funny’s goin’ on up in my house
Yeah, I started thinkin' maybe I should move out
You know, pack my cart, take a new route
Clean up my yard, get the noose out
Hang up my heart, let it air out
I’ve been searchin'
""What does that mean, Nate?"" I've been learning
Grabbin' my keepsakes, leavin’ my burdens
Well, I brought a few with me, I'm not perfect
Lookin' at the view, like this concerns me
Pickin' up the cues, right? I'm quite nervous
Hate it when I lose sight, life gets blurry
And things might hurt me
It's prolly gonna be a long journey, but hey
It's worth it, though
Cold world out there, kids, grab your coats
It's been a minute, I know, now I'm back to roam
Lookin' for the antidote to crack the code
Pretty vivid; I admit it, I'm in classic mode
Don't need pity given to me, but I can't condone
Talkin' down to me, I'ma have to crack your nose for crackin' jokes
I'm lookin' for the map to hope, you seen it?
Been makin' a whole lot of changes
Wrote a song about that, you should play it
I get scared when I walk on these stages
I look at the crowd and see so many faces, yeah
That's when I start to get anxious
That's when my thoughts can be dangerous
That's when I put on my makeup and drown in self-hatred
Forget what I'm saying, and—
Where'd the beat go?
Oh, ain't that somethin'?
Drums came in, you ain't see that comin'
Hands on my head, can't tell me nothin'
Got a taste of the fame, had to pump my stomach
Throw it back up like I don't want it
Wipe my face, clean off my vomit
OCD, tryna push my buttons
I said don't touch it, now y'all done it
I can be critical, never typical
Intricate with every syllable, I'm a criminal
Intimate, but never political, pretty visual
Even if you hate it, I'll make it feel like you're in it, though
You call me what you wanna, but never call me forgettable
Leave you deep in thought, I could never swim in the kiddie pool
Way that I been thinkin' is cinematic, it's beautiful
Man, I don't know if I'm makin' movies or music videos (Videos, videos)
Yeah, the sales can rise
Doesn't mean much though when your health declines
See, we've all got somethin' that we trapped inside
That we try to suffocate, you know, hopin' it dies
Try to hold it underwater but it always survives
Then it comes up out of nowhere like an evil surprise
Then it hovers over you to tell you millions of lies
You don't relate to that? Must not be as crazy as I am
The point I'm makin' is the mind is a powerful place
And what you feed it can affect you in a powerful way
It's pretty cool, right? Yeah, but it's not always safe
Just hang with me, this'll only take a moment, okay?
Just think about it for a second, if you look at your face
Every day when you get up and think you'll never be great
You'll never be great—not because you're not, but the hate
Will always find a way to cut you up and murder your faith (Woo)
I've been developin', take a look at the benefits
Nothin' to meddle with, I can never be delicate
Am I even relevant? That depends how you measure it
Take a measurement, then bag it up and give me the evidence
Pretty evident; dependable can never be tentative
I'm a gentleman, depending on if I think you're genuine
Pretty elegant, but not afraid to tell you to get a grip
Proper etiquette, I keep it to myself when I celebrate, ah
It's that time again
Better grab your balloons and invite your friends
Seatbelts back on, yeah, strap 'em in
Look at me, everybody, I'm smilin' big
On a road right now that I can't predict
Tell me ""Tone that down,"" but I can't resist
Y'all know that sound, better raise your fist
The search begins, I'm back, so enjoy the trip, huh

Everything Foreign, hahaha

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
What, I told her drop that ass, 'til you can't no more
Shake that ass up and down like your leg was broke
Take that big ol' booty girl, and scrub the ground
You fuck with a real nigga when the thugs were down

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
You done walked in like you ain't fit in the door
You don't listen to opinions from these sensitive hoes
Up and down on that dick like you ain't did it before
Shawty suck that shit like she invented the dome
I see lil' mama in here twerkin' like she don't work a job
She let me touch that body like I work in massage
Oh, she in her late 30s? She a bad lil' bitch
All that age shit don't matter, not a tad lil' bit
I take 'em 20, take 'em 30, take 'em 50 years old
Get her shakin' that ass like a video ho
She hit the club tonight in her pink dress
She hit that nigga like, 'Why the fuck ain't you pay my rent check?'

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Bounce that ass 'til you can't no more
Shake that ass up and down like your leg was broke
Take that big ol' booty girl, and scrub the ground
You fuck with a real nigga when the thugs were down

Make a nigga pop a tag, yeah, his tag, yeah

Bounce that ass, ho (Ass)
I'ma let cash go (Cash)
Bitch, you already know how my gang roll (Gang)
If they pull up, we turn it to the Stripper Bowl (Strippy!)
She with that shit, can she do it with a stick? (She wit it! Damn)
Big banana, can she do it on a split? (Bow!)
Get flew'd out, take you on your first trip (Oh)
Can't clock out 'til noon, 'cause you still countin' tips (No)
Pop out, say ""Ooh, lookin' good,"" with your bitch (Pop-out)
Rock out 'til June, in the summertime we lit (Rock out)
Pop up balloons, it's your birthday, bitch (Woo)
All the rich niggas wanna save this bitch (Uh)

You know who she call when she flew into town
She told me she would never fuck with me, look at her now
Got the Lambo sittin' low, bitch, scrapin' the ground
And my diamonds so loud, baguettes sing like Adele
Got your hooker on the sale, think I'm pimpin' for real
And these bitches love me, 'cause I ain't kissin' and tell

I've been ballin' 10 years, you ain't even on the field

She packed my bags last night, pre-flight
Zero hour: 9:00 a.m
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
I miss the Earth so much, I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight

And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home

[Verse 2]
Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
In fact, it's cold as hell
And there's no one there to raise them if you did
And all this science I don't understand
It's just my job five days a week
A rocket man
A rocket man

[Verse 1]
She packed my bags last night, pre-flight
Zero hour: 9:00 a.m
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
I miss the Earth so much, I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight

[Chorus]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone

[Verse 2]
Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
In fact, it's cold as hell
And there's no one there to raise them if you did
And all this science I don't understand
It's just my job five days a week
A rocket man
A rocket man

[Chorus]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find

This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
And nothing breaks like a heart

I heard you on the phone last night
We live and die by pretty lies
You know it, oh, we both know it
These silver bullet cigarettes
This burning house, there's nothing left
It's smoking, we both know it
We got all night to fall in love
But just like that, we fall apart
We're broken, we're broken

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Mmm, well, nothing, nothing, nothing gonna save us now

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Well, there's broken silence
By thunder crashing in the dark (Crash in the dark)

This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
Mhmm, and nothing breaks like a heart

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus]
We'll leave each other cold as ice
And high and dry, the desert wind
Is blowin', is blowin'
Remember what you said to me?
We were drunk in love in Tennessee
And I hold it, we both know it

But you know I fuckin' love her now
Like nobody ever could

[Refrain: Ed Sheeran]
And you know I stay trippin', am I crazy? Oh, no
I'm stickin' with my baby, for sure
Together, or solo

That she ain't the one to play with, oh no

But you don't know that my girl been doin' CrossFit
Pew, kung pow, hit your ass with a cross kick
Pulling hair out, wear you out, you exhausted
Know she gonna slide anytime you bitches talk shit
Keep a lil' blade in her fuckin' lip gloss kit, ayy
No one say hi to me without her
Better pay your respect to the queen
Better do that shit without a flirt
Gotta respect the HBIC
Couple of things that you need to know
If you still wanna be friends with me

[Intro]
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or better known as ADHD, is a mental disorder that affects an individual's ability to focus
Causing them to move around more frequently
They may also have trouble controlling their impulsive behaviors

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
One time for them prayin' on my downfall (Yeah)
Two times for the homies in the chow hall (Whoa)
Three times for them hoes on the internet
Shittin' on niggas when they really should get out more
Four times for the days that were all bad (Woo!)
Five times for the bitches who ain't called back (Yeah)
Six times for the kids like me who got ADHD just to— (Brap, brap, brap)

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Kidnap a nigga like ISIS (Whoa)
Turn a whole world to a crisis (Whoa)
Walk around the city with a ice pick
I been paranoid, usually, I ain't like this (Boop, boop)
Ain't no tellin' how crazy I might get, uh (Woo!)
Beat the police with a nightstick (Boop)
In my whole life, I been lifeless
Now I'm so fly, I'm a muhfuckin' flight risk (Woo! Whoa)
Fuck a couple hoes 'til I pass out (Whoa)
Niggas throwin' stones at my glass house (Whoa)
I remember sleepin' on my dad's couch (Whoa)
Now I got the Bentley, and it's blacked out (Whoa)
Family lookin' at me like a cash cow (Whoa)
Errybody dissin' just to have clout (Whoa)
Thought you had a chance, now you assed out
Nigga, I'm the muhfuckin' man, where you at now? (Whoa)
Fuck it, I'ma hit 'em 'til they jumpin'
I ain't trippin', this is nothin' (Brap, brap, brap)
I been livin' in the dungeon
I done held a couple grudges
Went to hell and got abducted
Meet the devil, I'm his cousin
I ain't settlin' for nothin' (Brap, brap, brap)
Got a metal in the truck, I keep a semi when I'm bussin'
Niggas duckin' (Bop)
Even Stevie Wonder could've see it comin' (Brrrap, brap, bop)
I ain't judgin', I just want the money, I don't need a budget
I been hungry, I ain't got no oven (Bop, bop, brrrap, brap)
But I got the munchies, nigga
How you gon' move on the front line? (Woo!)
If I don't fuck with you, I just cut ties (Whoa)
My high school teacher said I'd never be shit
Tell that bitch that I turned out just fine (Joyner)
And no, I don't know you for the twelfth time (Woo!)
We do not share the same bloodline (No)
You love to run your mouth like a tough guy
Hope you keep the same energy when it's crunch time (Woo!)

[Interlude]
According to the American Psychiatric Association
It affects roughly eight percent of children
And two percent of adults
Commonly believed to only affect boys
Because they are perceived as rowdy and rambunctious

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
One time for them prayin' on my downfall (Yeah)
Two times for them bitches in the South Shore (Whoa)
Three times for them days on the block
Gettin' chased by the cops like a motherfuckin' outlaw
Four times for them days that were all bad (Woo!)
Five times for the bitches who ain't called back (Yeah)
Six times for the kids like me who got ADHD just to— (Brap, brap, brap)

[Verse 2: Logic]
Me and Joyner need a couple hearses (Woo!)
Double homicide, kill the beat and the verses
Everybody livin' on the surface
But we came from the underground, yeah, we deserve it
What's beef?
Beef is when you murder motherfuckers on a beat
Kill 'em all, kill 'em all
Nah, nah, what's beef?
Beef is brothers dyin' over shit
That never mattered in the first place, lyin' in the street
What's peace?
Peace is when you leave it in the past, let it heal like a cast
When enough time pass, then you blast
Kinda like John Wick, bars like a convict
Fuck around and you don't wanna start shit, woo!
Comin' with the hot shit, all they do is talk shit
You could never top it, boy, just stop, stop it
High and drunk, call that HD vision
All these other motherfuckers full of indecision
And I murder with precision all over your television
I'm numero uno, number one and you is just a subdivision
Never listen, we gon' leave them missin'
That's the mission like ISIS (ISIS)
Ain't no time to bicker over who the nicest
It's Logic, it's obvious, just ask the audience
I've come to body this shit (Body this shit)
Yes, it's egregious, I'm Regis
You Kelly, you pussy, you pussy
Don't push me, I'm Louis Vuitton
You at Target with your mom
On the internet still hatin' on my last post (I hate this nigga)
I just sent a steak back at Mastro's, my god
Me and Joyner need a couple hearses (Woo!)
Double homicide, kill the beat and the verses
Everybody livin' on the surface
But we came from the underground, yeah, we deserve it
Yeah, uh, far from the minimum, killin' 'em with no Ritalin
And 5'9"" was the middleman to get 'em in the same room
Now we on the same tune, and we sealed the game's doom
The illest of lyricists on the same shit
RattPack, clap back on the gang shit
Do it for the love of rap, not for the fame shit, woo!

[Chorus: Logic]
One time for the Grammy that I never got
Two times for the Garden that I sold out
Three times for the street crimes that I committed
Yeah, I did it, but thank God that I made it out
Four times 'cause I'm a fuckin' bastard
Five times Platinum with my last shit
Six times for the beats and the rhymes
Fuck the heat and the crime
Keep the peace like a waistline, woo!

[Verse 1]
Seven months, two weeks and seven days
Since I left, who's counting anyway?
But for me the only thing that’s changed
Is the distance between New York and LA
Seven months, two weeks and seven days
Since I was so easily replaced
It's so strange how I recognize her face
But tell me, does she make you feel the same?
Kills me to know she's sleeping in my place

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s midnight and I'm wasted
So wasted, I'm wasted
I can't believe I'm calling you up again
I know I might be crazy
So crazy, I'm crazy
I can't believe I'm calling you just to say

[Letra de ""No Me Conoce (Remix)""]

[Intro: Bad Bunny & Jhay Cortez]
(Se hace la que no me conoce
Pero en mi cama se volvió un vicio como la 5-12)
(Yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh; ¿me sigue'?)
Nunca se deja ver (Nunca se deja ver; ¡no!)
Lo sabe disimular (Lo sabe disimular)
Tiene lo suyo y le va bien
Pero de noche conmigo le gusta portarse mal (Wuh-huh!)
Llega y lo que quiere es pecar, eh (Ey)
Está puesta pa’ bellaquear, eh (La presión)
Yo no la paro, y a veces mira raro y (¡Rrra!)

[Coro: Jhay Cortez & Bad Bunny]
Se hace la que no me conoce (La que no me conoce; no, no, no)
Pero en mi cama se volvió un vicio como la 5-12 (Como la 5-12)
Me la como entera y nadie se entera
Un par de amiga' (Un par de amiga'; wuh-huh)
To’as solteras, siempre la velan pa' que ella siga (Siga)
Se hace la que no me conoce (La que no me conoce)
Pero en mi cama se volvió un vicio como la 5-12 (Como la 5-12)
Me la como entera y nadie se entera
Un par de amiga' (¿Me sigue'?)
To'as solteras, siempre la velan pa' que ella siga

[Verso 1: Bad Bunny]
Huh-huh, eh
Si las miradas mataran, la tuya me hizo el amor (Eh)
Se ve que tú estás a vapor
Ella mata con traje y cuando se viste sport (Wuh)
Tiene el booty XL, pero usa los pantie' small
Una' pa’l no aguntan presión y la tienen bloqueá’, eh
Un pa'l de psycho, stalkeá’ (Eh)
No brega en la calle, pero está baqueá' (No)
La baby está muy dura, pa' mí que está hackeá' (Eh), eh
Chiquitita pero grandota, en la uni buenas nota’, eh
Niña buena, se le nota (Eh, eh), pero le explota la nota y (Ey)

[Coro: Bad Bunny & Jhay Cortez]
Se hace la que no me conoce (La que no me conoce; no, no, no)
Pero en mi cama, se lo metí en cuatro y en to'íta' las pose' (En to'íta' las pose'), eh
Me la como entera, nadie se entera
Con par de amiga' (Con par de amiga'; wuh-huh)
To'as solteras, siempre la velan pa' que ella siga (Pa' que ella siga; eh, eh-eh, eh)
Se hace la que no me conoce (La que no me conoce; no, no, no)
Pero en mi cama se volvió un vicio como la 5-12 (Como la 5-12)
Me la como entera y nadie se entera, un par de amiga' (Duro)
To'as solteras, siempre la velan pa' que ella siga
(Pa' que ella siga; ¿me sigue'?)

[Verso 2: J Balvin]
Me llama pa' que yo la pruebe y (Yah)
Cuando yo la toco, eso llueve ahí (-ve ahí)
Ella se vistió y yo la desvestí (Que sí)
Nunca dice: ""No"", siempre dice: ""Sí"" (Wuh)
Cuando quiere bailar, el dembow la azota (¿Qué?)
Ella se pone loca
Ella lo que quiere es peinarse (Wuh), y arreglarse (Wuh)
Llega a la disco a soltarse (Ah)
Que si me conoce, dice: ""No"", pero sabe bien que sí
Ella lo mezcla con alcohol, como cuando yo le di
En toda' las poses, preguntan y dice: ""No sé""
De contacto tiene ""José"", y siempre después de las 11 o 12

[Verso 3: Jhay Cortez]
Tira pa' que yo la pruebe
Se pone olorosa y me gusta como huele (Como huele)
Instagram privado pa' que nadie la vele
Se puso bonita porque sabe que hoy se bebe
A portarse mal pa' sentirse bien (Bien)
No quería fumar pero le dio al pen (Sí)
Una Barbie, pero no busca un Ken (No)
Siempre le llego cuando dice: ""Ven""
Pa' portarse mal se viste bien (Bien)
Dice la verdad y a vece' miente también
Apaga las notificacione' en el cel
Ella tiene lo suyo, pero hoy quiere joder

[Pre-Coro: Jhay Cortez]
Y yo le di por el expre-so
Le llené el cuello de be-so'
Le hice tiempo como un pre-so
Si la ve', no le hable' de e-so, que

Speak of the devil, my, oh my
Walk in with that devilish smile
That's one thing I haven't seen in a while
(In a while)
How have you been since I called you mine?
You look so good in this light
Got me reminiscin' 'bout our good times
(Good ol' times)

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know, I know, I know
We've been better off alone
But we laugh about old pictures on your phone and I forget
And you make, you make, you make it easy like a zephyr
You're still just the way I remember
Tonight I just wanna hit reverse

[Chorus]
Been a year since we finished
Baby, me and you, we vintage
But tonight you make me miss it
And I just wanna dance with you like
It's summer 1976
Raise my heart rate like it's interest
Jog my memory on your kisses
For old times sake, you got me singin'
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Got me singin'
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Got me dreamin'

Still as charismatic as ever
Comebacks come back clean and clever
Why we ended, I don't remember
Can't believe I once said ""See U Never""
Wait a minute, my head's a mess
Please don't tell me you like my dress
Why am I wishin' we were wearing less?
Won't be long before ""no"" becomes ""yes""

[Pre-Chorus]
And you know, you know, you know
All the ways to get to me
As if there were an easy recipe
A bit of hard-to-get, a dash of sweet
So I say, I say, we pay
Tribute to our history
Only reenactin', no repeats
Here we go again, I'ma handle you with care like you're antique

[Chorus]
Been a year since we finished
Baby, me and you, we vintage
But tonight you make me miss it
And I just wanna dance with you like
It's summer 1976
Raise my heart rate like it's interest
Jog my memory on your kisses
For old times sake, you got me singin'
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Got me singin'
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Got me dreamin'

Speak of the devil, my, oh my
Walk in with that devilish smile
That's one thing I haven't seen in a while

How have you been since I called you mine?
You look so good in this light
Got me reminiscin' 'bout our good times
(Good ol' times)

And I know, I know, I know
We've been better off alone
But we laugh about old pictures on your phone and I forget
And you make, you make, you make it easy like a zephyr
You're still just the way I remember
Tonight I just wanna hit reverse

I swear you gotta feel me before they try and kill me
They gotta make some choices, they runnin' out of options
'Cause I've been goin' off and they don't know when it's stoppin'
And when you get to toppin', I see that you've been learnin'
And when I take you shoppin', you spend it like you earned it
And when you popped off on your ex he deserved it
I thought you were the one from the jump that confirmed it

[Intro: Lenny Tavárez, Dalex, Sech & Nicky Jam]
The Avengers
Desde que estábamo' en la High (High)
Escribías mi nombre en tu cuaderno (Cuaderno; yeih)
Yo pienso en ti cuando estoy high
Y ahora picheas pa' comernos (Vamo' a verno')
Dame un ratito y más na' (Más na')
Después si quieres no te escribo más na' (Más na')
Parezco Google buscándote
Quiero hacer una serie que se llame ""To'a La Noche Dándote"", baby

[Pre-Coro: Dalex]
Dime, si andas con ese bobo o andas sola (Uh-yeh)
Yo en el Mercedes y él te tiene en el Corolla
Si un día de estos, baby, él a ti te descuida
Yo voy a hacerte mía

[Coro: Dalex & Nicky Jam]
Dime, cuándo vamo' a verno' pa' comerno' (Uh-yeh)
Si se te olvidó, yo te lo recuerdo (Uh-yeh)
Como te lo hacía-ía-ía, cuando te venía'-ía'-ía'
Dime, cuándo vamo' a verno' pa' comerno'
Si se te olvidó, yo te lo recuerdo
Como te lo hacía-ía-ía, cuando te venía'-ía'-ía'

[Verso 1: Sech]
Te digo, cuándo, hora, dónde y pasa
Que le pague a la gente de Waze pa' que borre el location de mi casa
Vendo noviecito, cuernudo a la brasa
Y si mi plan fracasa, mañana vuelve y pasa (Pasa)
Acuérdate cuando lo hicimo'
En el carro, en la cocina, esta serie no termina (No, no, no)
Baby, te tenía siempre encima (No)
Piensa en un número, ya te lo imaginas

[Verso 2: Nicky Jam]
Me dice' que me vaya, me pide' que me quede
Tú siempre 'tás jugando, contigo no se puede
Hasta que te me trepa' encima, yeh, te pongo disciplina, yeh
Nunca la dejo caer, siempre me pide otra ve' (Otra ve')
Otra ve' la tengo llamándome (Llamándome)
No se olvida de cómo la traté (Como la traté)
Que los plane' todos se los cambié (Los cambié, eh)
Y su novio, ahora se volvió su ex (Se volvió su ex)

[Verso 3: Lenny Tavárez]
Eh, mañana avísame si acaso te demora' (Te demora')
Pa' enseñarte cómo una pussy se devora (¡Yah!)
Una nueve seis al revé', tú sabe cómo e', en meno' de una hora
Shorty (Yah), yo sé tu' problema' con lo' jumper
No te cabe el bumper, te entreno ese booty (Booty)
Di que vas con tus amigas sola
Que en mi cama hay un party (Party)

Ponme un caption

Yo quiero repetir, ah'evo, sí

Pa' comernos, siempre tenemos que escondernos, yeh

Dime, si quiere' sentirlo (Yeh)
E' que no e' lo mismo oírlo que vivirlo
Si lo sube', mami, tiene' que disminuirlo
Encima trépate, como el colegio acuérdate (Yeh)
Quería picharle y del parque se la saqué (Se la saqué)
To' sus truco' ya los anoté (Anoté)
Y a su gato se la quité

The legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spiderman's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list

How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss

I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

I want something just like this

The legends and the myths
The testaments they told
The moon and its eclipse
And Superman unrolls
A suit before he lifts
But I'm not the kind of person that it fits

Que cuando calle, ello' ahí estarán

No quiero ser un peso para toda mi gente

Dale, avanza un poco más

Que estoy esperando por uno que me enamore
A la vieja escuela, que me mande flores
Quiero que me lleve al cine
Quiero que me robe un beso
Pero por la noche también se ponga travieso
Que ande por mi cama siempre sin pijama
Escuchando música todo el fin de semana

[Pre-Coro 2]

Si anda con Shakira, J-Lo o Karol G
Que me toque allá, que me toque ahí
Hasta que me encuentre espero ahí

Y que el proceso le repita
Y sé que no ha encontrado una que se lo permita
Yo soy tu favorita, se te nota en la carita

Y que el proceso le repita
Y sé que no ha encontrado una que se lo permita
Yo soy tu favorita, se te nota en la carita

[Pre-Coro 2]
Que sepa escoger, que sepa decidir
Si anda con Shakira, J-Lo o Karol G
Que me toque allá, que me toque ahí
Hasta que me encuentre espero ahí

[Coro]

[Intro]
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I shall die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

[Chorus]
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

[Verse 1]
I've tasted blood and it is sweet
I've had the rug pulled beneath my feet
I've trusted lies and trusted men
Broke down and put myself back together again
Stared in the mirror and punched it to shatters
Collected the pieces and picked out a dagger
I've pinched my skin in between my two fingers
And wished I could cut some parts off with some scissors

[Pre-Chorus]
""Come on, little lady, give us a smile""
No, I ain't got nothin' to smile about
I got no one to smile for, I waited a while for
A moment to say I don't owe you a goddamn thing

[Chorus]
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

[Post-Chorus]
I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night
That I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night

[Verse 2]
No, I won't smile, but I'll show you my teeth
And I'ma let you speak if you just let me breathe
I've been polite, but won't be caught dead
Lettin' a man tell me what I should do with my bed
Keep my exes in check in my basement
'Cause kindness is weakness, or worse, you're complacent
I could play nice or I could be a bully
I'm tired and angry, but somebody should be

[Pre-Chorus]

[Part 1: Samra]
Der Drecksbulle hält mich an, ich habe nix gestohl'n
Plane eine Flucht über Holland oder Pol'n
Ich hab' Alkohol im Blut, in der Levi's circa sechzig Mille
Und der Polizeibeamte lässt mir nur die letzte Kippe
Ich bretter' asozial, die Stimme, sie ist rau
Nase wieder mal gebrochen, Augen lila, grün und blau
Mach' den Lieferwagen auf, Kugeln liegen schon im Lauf
Wallah, ich geh' über Leichen, doch nie wieder in den Bau, rrah
Im Jogginganzug von Milan
Lila in der Tasche und wir rollen im Beamer
Kunden rufen an und ich muss sie beliefern
Wahre Brüder fallen, Libanon, Ukraina – rrah, rrah!
Hundert Gramm Haschplatte in der Hosentasche
Doch kann nicht kiffen, ich komm' grade von der Prophylaxe
Es riecht nach Olympéa Paco Rabanne
Wenn ich in bar mit Cataleya an der Kasse bezahl'

[Pre-Hook: Samra]
Mich jagen Großfamilien und das LKA
Wir sind Stars, aber ticken so wie Dealer
Brettern im Camaro mit 300 km/h
Capi, Samra zählen wieder Lila

[Hook: Samra]
Mich jagen Großfamilien und das LKA
Wir sind Stars, aber ticken so wie Dealer
Brettern im Camaro mit 300 km/h

[Part 2: Capital Bra]
Mich jagt das Finanzamt und die Mafia (Mafia)
Aber eigentlich ist es doch das Gleiche
Wieder mal ein Einsatz von dem SEK (SEK)
Die ganzen Wichser wollen ran an unsre Scheine (brra)
Black Jack, Pferderenn'n, Black Express American
​​iPhone-Handycam, Lamborghini Huracán
Ich steh' auf Komfort, Gucci, Louis, Tom Ford
Doch kann nicht schlafen, weil das SEK zu oft kommt
Verteil' das Zeug in der Siedlung
Treff' mich mit den Kunden vor der Autovermietung
Der Anzug ist von Chelsea, Bratan, du siehst uns (Bratan)
Und holst tief Luft
Er denkt, er kann Eier spiel'n, weil er Body hat (ah)
Aber ich hab' Makarow als mein Bodyguard (ja)
Russische Spezialeinheit schnappt mich in Stalingrad (woh)
Weil sie denken, dieser Ukro ist ein Oligarch (le le le, le le le)

[Intro: Jerrod Carmichael]
Sometimes you gotta close a door to open a window

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
I saw a photo, you looked joyous
My eyes are green, I eat my veggies
I need to get her out the picture
She's really fuckin' up my frame
She's not developed like we are

[Refrain: Tyler, The Creator]
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone
New magic, new magic, new magic wand
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone (Nigga)
New magic, new magic, new magic wand

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
My brother said I'm on the spectrum
Don't call me selfish, I hate sharin'
This 60-40 isn't workin'
I want a hundred of your time, you're mine

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & Santigold]
Please don't leave me now
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)
Please don't leave me now
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)
(Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone)
Please don't leave me now (I can make her leave)
(New magic, new magic, new magic wand)
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)
(Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone)
Please don't leave me now
(New magic, new magic, new magic wand)

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator & Santigold]
I wanna be found, passenger in your car (Don't leave)
You wanna be mean, mixed signals, don't park (I can make her leave)
She's gonna be dead, I just got a magic wand (Don't leave)
We can finally be together

[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
You roll the dice, hit a seven, sure you right
Beginner's luck, you not my first, who gives a fuck?
Your other one evaporate, we celebrate
You under oath, now pick a side and if you don't
(Run, run, run, run)
I'll pick you both
(Run, run, run, run)
It's not a joke, murder she wrote

[Verse 4: Tyler, The Creator]
Ayo, take one look in the mirror, implications so clear
I live life with no fear, except for the idea
That one day you won't be here
I will not fetch the ball
Eyes are green, I eat my vegetables
It has nothin' to do with that broad
But if it did, guarantee she'd be gone, well
I got a plan, 'bout to walk in the pen
If you can't understand, I'm a hawk in the gym
Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest
That I need to get off, or I ain't talkin' to them
Can't be in the picture if it got no frame
Gon' let the world know 'cause I ain't got no shame
Blow the whole spot up, 'cause I ain't–
I wanna share last names, I wanna be your number one
Not the other one, keep it on the low
I'm in my right mind, keep it on a high
Janis Joplin spillin' feelings, now I'm out here moppin' 'em
Four on the floor, pack up your bags, we hit the store
Grab our supplies, no need for masks, bust through the door
Get the job done like retirement, I admit you look concerned

DJ Khaled

[Verse 1: SZA & DJ Khaled]
Back against the wall, middle fingers in the air
Busting through the crowd, they gon' feel me now
Straight shooter from the hip, yeah, we heavy in here
Tell me get ’em, then I got 'em, yea (Get 'em)
99 problems, but you ain’t one
Been so high lately, I don't care who's goin' down
You could see it in my eyes, he been hitting it right
Got me wishing that he wasn't, oh no
And I need it all night
Will love show me what it feels like?
Fuck that, I let you pull up on me broad day light
Shots over here, fuck the other side
We don't gotta lay low, we grown
A field trip and I don't need no chaperone
I'm tryna get ghost
Oh, oh (Another one)

[Chorus: SZA]
It’s just us against the world
In this life of sin
Ain’t nobody gonna take us out
It's always us, never them
It’s just us against the world
When the smoke clears
All we got is all we got
It's always us, never them

[Verse 2: SZA & DJ Khaled]
It's lovely at the top, private destination
Sippin' on the rocks, only way with us
This kinda love dangerous when there’s nothing else to lose
So don't make me wild out (Let's ride)
Got 99 problems, what's one more?
50 feet get you touched at your front door
Livin' fast and we spending slow
Side eyes let me know that we visible
And I need it right now (Yeah)
Ten toes down, show me what it's all about
Thuggin', we only duckin' when the boys come out
It's us over them, fuck the other side
We gonna turn the lights off, we hard
What we doin', don't nobody gotta know
I ain't tryna get ghost, oh yes
Oh, oh

[Chorus: SZA]
It's just us against the world

[Part I]

[Verse 1]
Turn my lights on
How the fuck you quiet with the mic on?
I don't get anxiety, you Sam Bowie-ass niggas
I just get my Mike on
Y'all said I wouldn't go nowhere, I took the detour
When you see the someone in the crack right by the seashore?
When you see them brand new le Fleurs on the floor?
If the cops ask my name, bitch, I'm Igor

[Chorus]
Yuh, ayo
Yeah, yeah
Let's go, let's go, I ain't playin' around
Red nose, red nose, all you niggas is clowns
Niggas turning it up, well, shit, I'm tearing it down
Hard to believe in God when there ain't no mirrors around
What's up?

[Bridge]
Uh-huh, ayo
Uh-huh
Yeah, yo
Bitch

[Verse 2]
Running 'til the rims fall
Had them niggas and the cops looking jigsaw
I done fucked around and turned into the big dog
Better get God, get caught? Bitch, I think not
Yeah, new suit, new boots, same nigga, like what?
Lukewarm-ass niggas always wanna talk
I'm hot, I'm heat to the core like Earth
Don't touch, don't go, niggas might get buck

[Chorus]
Yo, yuh, ayo
Yeah, yeah
Let's go, let's go, I ain't playin' around

That car crash couldn't take me (Woo, ha)
Green haired angels all around me (Uh)
No answer why, no tears to cry, bitch, I'm alive (I see the)
That wasn't my endpoint like v-neck
I ain't have nobody to cheat on, I cheat death
New album, no repeat, I reset
Everything I deliver special like G. Dep
Two of 'em, I total, Kima, Pam
Me and death, the universe played middle man
Quick nap, kick back like horse, eyes shut
Loud sound, no scratch
Motherfuckers really thought I died
Hoping they could take a spot
Nigga not knowing that I'm one of one
And they some Helen Keller-ass niggas
And I got my eyes open now I see the...

When we took care of each other
We were livin' for each other

[Pre-Chorus]
But I start to wonder, wonder
If I'm slipping under, under (Oh, oh)

[Chorus]
Would you rescue me? Would you get my back?
Would you take my call when I start to crack?
Would you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me?
Would you rescue me when I'm by myself?
When I need your love, if I need your help
Would you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me?
Would you rescue me? Would you get my back?
Would you take my call when I start to crack?
Would you rescue me? Ah
Would you rescue me? (Would you rescue me?)
Would you rescue me when I'm by myself?
When I need your love, if I need your help
Would you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me?

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I miss all the times we had
Can't forget what you can't get back
And you can't find it in another
Man, time, it ain't your lover
I don't care what you thought before
I'll be there anytime you call
Don't you ever call another
No need to call another

[Pre-Chorus]
And I start to wonder, wonder
If I'm slipping under, under (Oh, oh)

[Chorus]
Would you rescue me? Would you get my back?
Would you take my call when I start to crack?
Would you rescue me? Ah
Would you rescue me? (Would you rescue me?)
Would you rescue me when I'm by myself?
When I need your love, if I need your help
Would you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me? (Yeah)

[Bridge]
Would you rescue me?
Oh, rescue me (Would you rescue me?)
Would you rescue me? (When I'm by myself?)
(When I need your love, if I need your help)
Oh, rescue me
(Would you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me?)

[Chorus]
Would you rescue me? Would you get my back?
Would you take my call when I start to crack?
Would you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me?
Would you rescue me when I'm by myself?
When I need your love, if I need your help
Would you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me?

[Strofa 1]
In periferia fa molto caldo
Mamma stai tranquilla, sto arrivando
Te la prenderai per un bugiardo
Ti sembrava amore ma era altro
Beve champagne sotto Ramadan
Alla TV danno Jackie Chan
Fuma narghilè, mi chiede come va

[Pre-Ritornello]
Mi chiede come va, come va, come va
Sai già come va, come va, come va
Penso più veloce per capire se domani tu mi fregherai
Non ho tempo per chiarire perché solo ora so cosa sei
È difficile stare al mondo
Quando perdi l'orgoglio
Lasci casa in un giorno
Tu dimmi se

[Ritornello 1]
Pensavi solo ai soldi, soldi
Come se avessi avuto soldi, soldi
Dimmi se ti manco o te ne fotti, fotti
Mi chiedevi come va, come va, come va
Adesso come va, come va, come va

Ciò che devi dire non l'hai detto
Tradire è una pallottola nel petto
Prendi tutta la tua carità
Menti a casa ma lo sai che lo sa

I wanna walk to your front door and knock

And we ride through the park, chase the sun

Do you need bread? Do you need this?
Do you need a hug? Do you need to be alone?

[Part I: GONE, GONE]

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Comparing scars before dinner
Jump off the roof into the mirror
Felt like summer to my December
Was it my August? Shit, I don't remember
(Two, three, go)
I know my temperature was set
You finally flew south
The bird gon' leave the nest, you're so chromatic
At least I had it (Uh)
Instead of never
Or maybe I'm too dramatic
(Two, three, go)

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
(Two, three, go)
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, gone

[Post-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
I know love is, is all I got
I just hope to God she got good taste
Could put you on some shit you never seen
Could play a couple songs that you could dance to
I hope you know she can't compete with me

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, gone

[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
You kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Keep)
You kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Keep)
You kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Gone, gone, gone)
Going, and now I'm scarred for life

[Interlude: CeeLo Green]
My love is gone (Gone), my love is gone (Gone)
My love is gone (It's gone), my love is gone

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Ayo, it's poison in that gumbo
Emotion, feel Dumbo
Ask me where my love go
That bitch walked outside the front door
Knock, knock, knock, knock
I'm not shocked, I brought this on me
It's my fault, you gon' leave
Lesson taught, see
The weatherman told me it wasn't rainin'
My stupid ass brought umbrellas
I got a glimpse of your cloud and felt better
Now it's 90 degrees, and all the tricks up my sleeve
Is drenched in sweat and delusion because I jet to conclusions
You got your thing, I got nothing but memories
I know your secrets, nigga (Yeah)
I'm not bitter or nothing, I understand that
Everybody making a choice according to plan and
We had two different blueprints, but understood influence
You opened up early on, I thought I had a permit
You started buildin' a bridge and turned it into a fence
Then my buildin' got tore down all because of your new tenant
I'll just buy up some new shit, never down with a lease
You never lived in your truth, I'm just happy I lived in it
But I finally found peace, so peace
(Want me do it over? Everything)

[Outro: Jerrod Carmichael]
I hate wasted potential, that shit crushes your spirit
It really does, it crushes your soul

[Part II: THANK YOU]

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Thank you for the love
Thank you for the joy
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again
Thank you for the time
Thank you for your mind, mind

They say my time is almost up, tell them bitches, ""Wish, wish""
All these hoes lookin' cold, all these bitches fish sticks
Put a ribbon on my box 'cause this pussy gifted

See my ring, my watch, my chain and everything is lit, lit (Ice)
All this gold on a bitch, I feel like I'm Slick Rick
If they love me or they hate me, it don't make no difference (Cardi)
It be hard not to kill a ho 'cause I be tempted

[Verse 1: Cardi B]
Now I be countin' money, buyin' jewelry, hoes be ridin' dick (Dick)
I just make my M's and mind my business, hoes be ridin' dick (Dick)
""I can see Cardi eat so much,"" and that's what got 'em sick
But I wonder how they still ain't pregnant, all that riding dick
Y'all betta go ahead with that weak shit, I'm certified, real street bitch
Won't be a song if I leak shit, we strapped up like defense
Whatever you do, sis, keep it cute, sis
Leave that beefin' shit at Ruth Chris or end up toothless
I've been official my whole life, I bought burners, I ain't buy likes (Brr)
How did little ol' me get money? Got everybody all tight
These bitches wack, these bitches garb (Garb), they diss me, I disregard
Bet you if I had a dick, these bitches couldn't get it hard

Came from the bottom, I'm a multimillionaire, I was just sleeping on pallets (21)
Fuck these rappers, I'm 4L gang, we the best like DJ Khaled (Straight up)
Your bitch got that crazy head like a Kanye tweet (21)
Had a wedding for my Glocks, call 'em Jay and Bey (21)
I split the rent with my chopper 'cause it stay with me (On God)
Leave you drunk like a shot of liquor, ain't no chasin' me (On God)
He threw in a white flag, but I still want beef (Stupid)

DJ Khaled

[Chorus: John Legend]
Oh, you keep taking me higher and higher (Yeah)
But don't you know that the devil is a liar? (Yeah, I know)
They'd rather see me down, put my soul in the fire
But we keep goin' higher, higher

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Look, look
My granny 88, she had my uncle and then
A miscarriage back-to-back every year for like ten
Pregnant with my moms, doctor told her it was slim
Was bed rode for nine months, but gave birth in the end
Pops turned 60, he proud what we done
In one generation, he came from Africa young
He said he met my moms at the Century Club
Los Angeles love kinda of like Hussle and Boog
Mani turned ten, Kross turned two
Startin' to see this life shit from a bird's view
We the ones that made millions off the curb, fool
In this rap shit ten, never made nerd moves

[Chorus: John Legend]
Oh, you keep taking me higher and higher (Yeah)
(Hussle, Khaled)
But don't you know that the devil is a liar? (Yeah, I know)
(Right back)
They'd rather see me down, put my soul in the fire
But we keep goin' higher, higher (Woah, woah)
(Nip, talk to 'em)

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle & John Legend]
Emptied out the clip, it was broad day
Fuck niggas always gotta learn the hard way
We gon' tape it off if we ball play
Put a half a moon crescent on your bald fade
Police hit the lights, that's a car chase
Lookin' back at my life make my heart race
Dance with the devil and test our faith
I was thinkin' chess moves but it was God's grace
Crooked ass whoever 'til we all straight
With no shame, I peeped game and it's all fake
South Central state of mind, high crime rate (Yeah)
Homicide, hate, gang banging'll get you all day (Yeah, yeah)
And look at my fate

[Chorus: John Legend & Nipsey Hussle]
Oh, you keep taking me higher and higher (Yeah)
(Told Khaled bounce the four 'til the bar break)
But don't you know that the devil is a liar? (I know)
They'd rather see me down, put my soul in the fire
But we keep goin' higher, higher

[Outro: John Legend]
Higher
Oh, Lord
Can you feel it?
My shoes are scrapin' the sky

[Intro: DJ Khaled]
We The Best music
DJ Khaled

[Chorus: John Legend]
Oh, you keep taking me higher and higher (Yeah)
But don't you know that the devil is a liar? (Yeah, I know)
They'd rather see me down, put my soul in the fire
But we keep goin' higher, higher

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Look, look
My granny 88, she had my uncle and then
A miscarriage back-to-back every year for like ten
Pregnant with my moms, doctor told her it was slim
Was bed rode for nine months, but gave birth in the end
Pops turned 60, he proud what we done
In one generation, he came from Africa young
He said he met my moms at the Century Club
Los Angeles love kinda of like Hussle and Boog
Mani turned ten, Kross turned two
Startin' to see this life shit from a bird's view
We the ones that made millions off the curb, fool
In this rap shit ten, never made nerd moves

[Chorus: John Legend]
Oh, you keep taking me higher and higher (Yeah)
(Hussle, Khaled)
But don't you know that the devil is a liar? (Yeah, I know)
(Right back)
They'd rather see me down, put my soul in the fire
But we keep goin' higher, higher (Woah, woah)
(Nip, talk to 'em)

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle & John Legend]
Emptied out the clip, it was broad day
Fuck niggas always gotta learn the hard way
We gon' tape it off if we ball play
Put a half a moon crescent on your bald fade
Police hit the lights, that's a car chase
Lookin' back at my life make my heart race
Dance with the devil and test our faith
I was thinkin' chess moves but it was God's grace
Crooked ass whoever 'til we all straight
With no shame, I peeped game and it's all fake
South Central state of mind, high crime rate (Yeah)
Homicide, hate, gang banging'll get you all day (Yeah, yeah)
And look at my fate

[Chorus: John Legend & Nipsey Hussle]
Oh, you keep taking me higher and higher (Yeah)
(Told Khaled bounce the four 'til the bar break)
But don't you know that the devil is a liar? (I know)
They'd rather see me down, put my soul in the fire
But we keep goin' higher, higher

[Outro: John Legend]
Higher
Oh, Lord
Can you feel it?
My shoes are scrapin' the sky
I'm so high
We keep goin' higher

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I pick you up in my ride
Make sure you waitin' outside when I pull up
I told my niggas I can't slide (No, no)
Just to be right by your side
I could've been anywhere, but I'm right here
I want you all to myself
I grab your hips and I
Tell you you're the one for me (Yup)
Tell you I got all I need
'Cause I want your body (Your body), yeah, yeah
All over my body (Body)
And I know that they hatin', they say I'm no good
But I know that they watchin' (No, no)

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & DJ Khaled]
Girl, I can tell you need some love in your life (Let's ride)
And I'm the one, don't let no one change your mind
Fuck what they say (Fuck 'em)

[Chorus: Chris Brown, DJ Khaled, & Lil Wayne]
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous (Let's go)
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
You mad or you jealous, you sad or you settle
The brighter the rainbow, the badder the weather
The good with the bad, but the badder the better
Bring my sand to the beach, nigga, and to the desert
We fell from the heavens, we landed like feathers
The rose in the rubble, keep your nose out our petals
Your hoes know my schedule, and my hoes know I'm special
They know not to question, bitch, you know I'm not Alexa
She, she post a pic of me and her from off her iPad
You know them hoes don't like that, where the likes at?
Jealousy is a disease, you can die mad
Tunechi, Sean, CB, Khaled, hi there (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown, DJ Khaled, & Lil Wayne]
But girl, I can tell you need some love in your life (Mulah,
Let's ride)
And I'm the one, don't let no one change your mind (Oh, na, na, na)
Fuck what they say (Fuck 'em)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & DJ Khaled]
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous (Let's go)
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous (Oh, oh, woah)
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether (Oh, oh, girl, they just)
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous (Woah)
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether (Woah)
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous (Jealous)
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether (Together)

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Dawg, it's these jealous ass hoes I can't relate to
The type to follow you but hardly follow through
You say I'm on your mind, I'm wondering why I'm not on you
Girl, you're fresh out the shower
Towel around your head like you're Erykah Badu
It's lookin' like a spa day
I rearrange your chakras, listenin' to Sade
Let's take a road trip and get high on the highway (Swerve, swerve)
Migrate, spend time, lay back, watch the sky change, woah
And I hear the jealousy, but look, I never listen
The quickest way to let something die is lack of attention (Straight up)
And you got it all, you looking good as my intentions (Damn)
We on an ascension, straight up

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & DJ Khaled]
But girl, I can tell you need some love in your life (Let's ride)

Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether (Woah)
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous (Jealous)
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether (Together)

[Bridge: Chris Brown & DJ Khaled]
These boys scared I'ma take they chick (They chick)
Must be the money, 'cause a young boy rich (Real rich)
You could drop a dime, but I make it make sense
Girl, you coming home with me
You the last number on my call list (Call list)
Pull up on me, girl, let's get lit (Get lit)
I think I hit a lick
I think I hit a lick, yeah (Another one)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & DJ Khaled]
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous (Jealous, let's go)
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether (No, they don't want us)
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous (Jealous)
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether (Together)

[Intro: MAX]
Would you love me less?
If you knew the places that I've been?
If you knew the damage that I did?
Would you love me less? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[Verse 1: MAX]
I got too much dirt to come clean
Closets full of skeletons that you don't wanna see
Will you judge me? All my ugly?
I won't blame you if you do
No lies, don't wanna keep no secrets
Even if what I'ma say will you leave speechless
No secrets
If I introduce you to my demons, tell me

[Chorus: MAX]
Baby, would you love me less
If you knew the places that I've been?
If you knew the damage that I did?
Oh, would you love me less? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Would you love me less
If I had a dollar for my sins?
If you knew the beds that I've been in?
Oh, would you love me less? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[Verse 2: Quinn XCII]
I'm happy you never saw me in college
Blood on my hands I refuse to acknowledge
That's why I get light-headed, thin ice that I'm treadin'
Soft conversations in our bed, my skin's sweatin'
She doesn't like my list of exes I've had at home
She's buggin', sounding childish like a xylophone
Knees buckling, hearing that falsetto that's in her tone
If I introduce you to my demons, tell me

[Chorus: MAX, Quinn XCII, & MAX and Quinn XCII]
Baby, would you love me less (Love me less)
If you knew the places that I've been? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
If you knew the damage that I did? (Damage that I did)
Oh, would you love me less? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Now, would you love me? Now, would you love me?)
Would you love me less (Would you love me less?)
If I had a dollar for my sins? (Oh, hey yeah, yeah)
If you knew the beds that I've been in? (Oh, hey yeah, yeah)
Oh, would you love me less? No, no, no, no, no, no
(Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah)

[Bridge: MAX & Quinn XCII]
Or would you love me more?
Or would you love me more?
If you knew the person that I was, yeah yeah
If you knew the power of your love to change me
(Oh, hey yeah, yeah)
And if I introduce you to my demons, tell me

[Chorus: MAX, Quinn XCII, & MAX and Quinn XCII]
Baby, you won't love me less (Love me less)
If you knew the places that I've been
(If you knew the places, yeah, yeah)
If you knew the damage that I did? (The trouble that I'm in)
Oh, would you love me less? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Would you love me less (Would you love me less?)
If I had a dollar for my sins?
(Oh, hey yeah, yeah, a dollar for my sins, now)

[Intro]
Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go
(I'll never kill myself to save my soul)
I'm finally holding on to letting go
(I didn't come this far to sink so low)
I'm finally holding on to letting go

[Verse 1]
I'm just weathering a rough patch
Another villain with an itch to scratch
Denial is the darkest when you live in a hole
Why does the hell make you feel so cold?
Make a move and you pay for it
Pick a lord and you pray to it
You're so demanding when you want the truth
But your stories don't read for me

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go

[Verse 2]
Indecision overload
Keep a buckle on the devil and your eyes on the road
Reaching out for the hand of God
But did you think you'd shake your own?
This killing field is all grown over
The motherfucker wants it wild
Go sow your oats in alphabetical order
The anti-antagonist is back in style
Myopic, cannot see straight
Dystopic, one sin too late
You gotta lie if you wanna believe
But your bibles don't work on me

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting
Go

[Bridge]
Did you think you could win? And fill me in?
Did you think you could do it again? I'm not your sin
I was all that you wanted and more, but you didn't want me
I was more than you thought I could be
So I'm setting you free, I'm setting you free
You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me
You've killed the saint in me

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go

[Strophe 1]
Du (du hast, du hast, du hast, du hast)
Hast viel geweint (geweint, geweint, geweint, geweint)
Im Geist getrennt (getrennt, getrennt, getrennt, getrennt)
Im Herz vereint (vereint, vereint, vereint, vereint)
Wir (wir sind, wir sind, wir sind, wir sind)
Sind schon sehr lang zusammen (ihr seid, ihr seid, ihr seid, ihr seid)
Dein Atem kalt (so kalt, so kalt, so kalt, so kalt)
Das Herz in Flammen (so heiß, so heiß, so heiß, so heiß)
Du (du kannst, du kannst, du kannst, du kannst)
Ich (ich weiß, ich weiß, ich weiß, ich weiß)
Wir (wir sind, wir sind, wir sind, wir sind)

Deutschland – mein Herz in Flammen
Will dich lieben und verdammen
Deutschland – dein Atem kalt
So jung – und doch so alt
Deutschland!

[Strophe 2]
Ich (du hast, du hast, du hast, du hast)
Ich will dich nie verlassen (ich weiß, ich weiß, ich weiß, ich weiß)
Man kann dich lieben (du liebst, du liebst, du liebst, du liebst)
Und will dich hassen (du hast, du hast, du hast, du hast)
Überheblich, überlegen
Übernehmen, übergeben
Überraschen, überfallen
Deutschland, Deutschland über allen

[Songtext zu „Letzte Träne“]

[Hook]
Die letzte Träne, die ich hab'
Wer ist sie noch wert?
Denn der Platz in meiner Brust ist leer
Die letzte Träne, die du hast
Ich bin sie nicht wert
Denn der Platz in meiner Brust ist leer

[Part 1]
Mann, niemand hat gesagt, dass die Straße nicht kalt ist
Aber wenn dein Bruder wieder fünf Jahre reingeht
Auch wenn ich nix fühl', fühl' ich das Heimweh
Mama hatte Tränen in den Augen, aber weint nicht
Dem Elend ist egal, ob die Alben auf Eins geh'n
Weil meine Tage wieder zu schnell vorbeigeh'n
Und Gott mag dir die Sünden vergeben, mein Freund
Aber glaub mir, der Teufel verzeiht nicht
Auch wenn man denkt, man hat alles geseh'n
Das kaputte Leben ist grade okay
Kommt von der Seite der dreckige Bastard, das „Schicksal“
Nimmt dir die Liebsten und geht
Blut und Regen vermischt mit gebrochenen Egos
Fließen zusamm'n den Bordstein entlang
Doch auch in den dunkelsten Ecken des Elends
Blühen die Rosen bei Sonn'nuntergang

[Hook]
Die letzte Träne, die ich hab'
Wer ist sie noch wert?
Denn der Platz in meiner Brust ist leer
Die letzte Träne, die du hast
Ich bin sie nicht wert
Denn der Platz in meiner Brust ist leer

[Part 2]
Ich kann schweigen wie der Tod
Aber rede mit dem Mond, wenn ich einschlaf'
Sehe meine Augen in den Augen meines Sohns
Doch Papa, meine Augen sehen zu viele Geister
Alles sieht rot
Jeder würde gerne hoch, aber keiner
Teilt gerne Brot, aber lieber dein Gold
Und die Tage voller Regen enden immer nur einsam
Junge, nur der Mann macht das Geld, nicht das Geld macht den Mann
Aber leider seh'n die meisten das anders
Nur der Weg, der dich bis an die Tore der Hölle führt
Ist mit leeren Versprechen gepflastert
Tränen und Regen vermischt mit gebrochenen Träumen
Fließen zusamm'n den Bordstein entlang
Doch auch in den dunkelsten Ecken des Elends
Blühen die Rosen bei Sonn'nuntergang

[Hook]
Die letzte Träne, die ich hab'
Wer ist sie noch wert?
Denn der Platz in meiner Brust ist leer
Die letzte Träne, die du hast
Ich bin sie nicht wert
Denn der Platz in meiner Brust ist leer
Die letzte Träne, die ich hab'
Wer ist sie noch wert?
Denn der Platz in meiner Brust ist leer
Die letzte Träne, die du hast
Ich bin sie nicht wert
Denn der Platz in meiner Brust ist leer

[Bridge]
Ich zähle nicht mehr nach, die Probleme, die ich hab'
Fallen wie der Regen in der Nacht, wie der Regen auf die Stadt
Und all die Knete, die du machst, macht dem Elend keinen Platz
Also wer ist sie noch wert?

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie, yeah
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
Then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, ""Shall we dance?"" (Hell, yeah)
You know I love ya, did I ever tell ya?
You make it better like that

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say (Yeah)
I always feel like I'm nobody, mmm
Who wants to fit in anyway?

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near

Tryna talk, but we can't hear ourselves

I'm crippled with anxiety
But I'm told it's where I'm s'posed to be
You know what? It's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind
When you make it better like that

Don't think we fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, oh yeah, yeah

[Part 1: Juju]
Weißt du noch, als wir am Meer war'n?
Baby, wie lang ist es schon her, als
Du meintest, du wirst immer bei mir bleiben? Und das Meersalz
Hat so geglitzert auf der braunen Haut, noch mehr als
Unsre beiden Augen, weil das Leben zu uns fair war
Wir haben gefickt und der Himmel war so stern'nklar
Ich vermisse dich, vermisse ohne Schwerkraft
Mit dir rumzuschweben, der Absturz war so schmerzhaft
Ich muss mich ablenken, muss wieder Musik machen
Guck mir zu, ich füll' ab heut alleine meine Brieftasche
„Aber was schreibe ich bloß?“, frag' ich mich
Diese Wohnung ist auf einmal so groß ohne dich
Alle unsre Wünsche haben wir zerstört
Steige wieder in den Tourbus und ich riech' an deinem Shirt
Mal sehen, ob der Duft noch bleibt
Bis ich wieder aus dem Bus aussteig'

[Hook: Juju, Juju & Henning May]
Wie kann man jemand so krass vermissen
Wie ich dich in diesem scheiß Augenblick?
Ich bin grade so krass zerrissen
Soll ich dir einfach wieder schreiben oder nicht?
Wie kann man jemand so krass vermissen
Wie ich dich in diesem scheiß Augenblick?
Ich bin grade so krass zerrissen
Soll ich dir einfach wieder schreiben oder nicht?

[Part 2: Henning May]
Ich will nicht mehr wissen, wie es war
Ich will nicht mehr wissen, warum es vorbei ist
Ich will nicht mehr wissen, wie es war
Ich will nicht wissen, was du machst, wenn du high bist
Ich häng' besoffen ab in irgendwelchen Bars
Und ich merke, dass ich ohne dich allein bin
Augenringe spiegeln sich in meinem Glas
Ich hab' dich geh'n lassen wie 'n Feigling
Und ich wart' auf ein Signal
Nur noch ein letztes Mal, doch das ändert nichts
Denn mir ist klar, es wird nie mehr, wie es war
Es ist nachts, ich bin wach und ich denk' an dich

[Hook: Juju & Henning May]
Wie kann man jemand so krass vermissen

Ich bin grade so krass zerrissen
Soll ich dir einfach wieder schreiben oder nicht?
Wie kann man jemand so krass vermissen
Wie ich dich in diesem scheiß Augenblick?
Ich bin grade so krass zerrissen
Soll ich dir einfach wieder schreiben oder nicht?

[Part 2: Henning May]
Ich will nicht mehr wissen, wie es war
Ich will nicht mehr wissen, warum es vorbei ist
Ich will nicht mehr wissen, wie es war
Ich will nicht wissen, was du machst, wenn du high bist
Ich häng' besoffen ab in irgendwelchen Bars
Und ich merke, dass ich ohne dich allein bin
Augenringe spiegeln sich in meinem Glas
Ich hab' dich geh'n lassen wie 'n Feigling
Und ich wart' auf ein Signal
Nur noch ein letztes Mal, doch das ändert nichts
Denn mir ist klar, es wird nie mehr, wie es war
Es ist nachts, ich bin wach und ich denk' an dich

[Hook: Juju & Henning May]
Wie kann man jemand so krass vermissen
Wie ich dich in diesem scheiß Augenblick?
Ich bin grade so krass zerrissen
Soll ich dir einfach wieder schreiben oder nicht?
Wie kann man jemand so krass vermissen
Wie ich dich in diesem scheiß Augenblick?
Ich bin grade so krass zerrissen
Soll ich dir einfach wieder schreiben oder nicht?

[Outro: Juju & Henning May]
Wie kann man jemand so krass vermissen?
Wie kann man jemand so krass vermissen?

Don't do it for money, don't do it for money
But if it come down to the money
I got a lot
I got a lot, like a lot
More than I need
I got children to feed, I got places to be
I got bitches to fuck, let me see your ID
Nah, I'm just playin', I'm playin'
You know that I'm playin', don't know what I'm sayin', no
Know that we chillin', we vibin'
We smokin' and drinkin', we gettin' this money though

That boy Logic flow so cold, loco, crazy, silly
You ever gon' stop rappin'?
I'm thinkin' no, no, not really, ayy
I be quick to put an ugly bitch in her place
'Cause a beautiful woman is something to see
And she's not defined by her face
Can't fuck with no girl that be all on the 'Gram
Tryna post while I'm eatin' spaghetti
Damn, girl, can't you be normal?
I'm famous as fuck, yeah, we get it already
But who give a shit about that
I am a good man, how 'bout that?
No way in hell I'm defined by the stat
Smokin' that pack, let me get it back
Let me get up in it, let me hit it like that
If you wanna come and get it with the RattPack
Like ayy, I'ma be here forever and a day
I be at the Grammy party with Jay and Bey
Oh shit, yeah, that's me

I had a plot as a kid to get rich
Hah, listen, lil' bitch
Got the game in my hand like a Switch
It's just me and my clique
Rap and get money, rap and get money
Said rap and get money, motherfucker
Ain't this shit funny?
Don't do it for money, don't do it for money
But if it come down to the money
I got a lot
I got a lot, like a lot
More than I need
I got children to feed, I got places to be
I got bitches to fuck, let me see your ID
Nah, I'm just playin', I'm playin'
You know that I'm playin', don't know what I'm sayin', no
Know that we chillin', we vibin'
We smokin' and drinkin', we gettin' this money though
Follow me, follow me, follow me
All the way, all the way into my paradise

I stay fresh and clean clean like André 3-thou' (Thou')
I was a big boy since a kid, now the world found out (Huh?)
Mom named me Radric 'cause I'm radical (Yeah)
Teamed up with Logic, he threw me a lateral (Dope)
Big gold solitaires, that's collateral (Bling)
She a Wop stan, she so fanatical (Mwah)
Fall out when they see me, they dramatical
She ain't icy enough, we're not compatible

At the Garden, sitting courtside, look around like, ""Oh my God""
I just sold this motherfucker out, I ain't even try
I ain't one to floss, but I got plaques, run it back
Once I touch down, I go deep like a running back
Just jumped on the private jet and rolled a joint
Played the beat then wrote that joint
Wrote a whole movie, then I sold that joint
Fuck Illuminati, that boy 6ix got my back
6ix made this beat, 6ix bring the heat you got on repeat
Word on the street
Can't no one compete, I'm spectacular
That boy got the sauce on the RAGÚ-lar
I don't play no games 'less we talkin' Fortnite
Finally knew I made it, sittin' at the red light
When them soccer moms pull up in they van while I ride
Like, ""Oh my God, children, it's the 1-800 guy""
But my doors suicide, yeah, I'm too alive
Bitch, I have arrived, everybody know I'm one hell of a guy
I ain't tryna fuck your girl, I'm tryna fuck your mama
Fuck the drama, bank account got a extra comma
Yeah, they sweat me like the sauna
Red carpet in my own merch, like that shit is designer
Did you know I'm mixed like Obama?
It ain't a project if Logic ain't talkin' 'bout being biracial
Bicoastal, I'm platinum, go postal, I'm snappin'
Yeah, you know Bobby, but prolly' only know my new shit

Yeah, you know you made it when they make a meme for ya
Haters that never made it, I'm livin' the dream for ya
Roll up, grab the kush and then roll up
Hold up, better give me what I want when I show up
You know what I do, not who coming through
How 'bout you?
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, you're cool
I don't fuck with nobody like mean girls in high school
I don't give a damn that I'm famous
Why it seem like every single celebrity shameless, it's dangerous
Got 50 million but my swag on food stamps
All these models poppin' bottles, bitch, I ain't tryna dance
She said, ""No, I don't wanna pay my bills""
I need a hard workin' woman with respect who will
This for everybody who ain't made it yet
Got five degrees and six figures in debt
Follow your dreams ho, follow your— follow your—, uh
Somebody calling your, uh, it's destiny
Hold up with the turn up for a second man, who's testing me?
I got so much power, don't know why the heavens blessing me
PLP, I think that is the recipe
So I'ma take a moment, use my power for good
Fuck the bullshit, do what you love and get out the hood

Like, ""Oh my God, children, it's the 1-800 guy""
But my doors suicide, yeah, I'm too alive
Bitch, I have arrived, everybody know I'm one hell of a guy
I ain't tryna fuck your girl, I'm tryna fuck your mama
Fuck the drama, bank account got a extra comma
Yeah, they sweat me like the sauna
Red carpet in my own merch, like that shit is designer
Did you know I'm mixed like Obama?
It ain't a project if Logic ain't talkin' 'bout being biracial
Bicoastal, I'm platinum, go postal, I'm snappin'
Yeah, you know Bobby, but prolly' only know my new shit
That trap shit, that cool shit, but they all know that fool spit

[Chorus]
I'm the one, bitch, I am the one, like Keanu Reeves
Get it done, yeah I get it done, no blood on the leaves
They can't leave us hangin', no, no, not no more, best believe
Yeah, that shit is banging, Bobby killed it with no time to grieve
I'm the one, bitch, I am the one, like Keanu Reeves
Get it done, yeah, I get it done, no blood on the leaves
They can't leave us hangin', no, no, not no more, best believe
Yeah, that shit is banging, Bobby killed it with no time to grieve, ayy

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you know you made it when they make a meme for ya
Haters that never made it, I'm livin' the dream for ya
Roll up, grab the kush and then roll up
Hold up, better give me what I want when I show up
You know what I do, not who coming through
How 'bout you?
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, you're cool
I don't fuck with nobody like mean girls in high school
I don't give a damn that I'm famous
Why it seem like every single celebrity shameless, it's dangerous
Got 50 million but my swag on food stamps
All these models poppin' bottles, bitch, I ain't tryna dance
She said, ""No, I don't wanna pay my bills""
I need a hard workin' woman with respect who will
This for everybody who ain't made it yet
Got five degrees and six figures in debt
Follow your dreams ho, follow your— follow your—, uh
Somebody calling your, uh, it's destiny
Hold up with the turn up for a second man, who's testing me?
I got so much power, don't know why the heavens blessing me
PLP, I think that is the recipe
So I'ma take a moment, use my power for good
Fuck the bullshit, do what you love and get out the hood

[Chorus]
I'm the one, bitch, I am the one, like Keanu Reeves
Get it done, yeah I get it done, no blood on the leaves
They can't leave us hangin', no, no, not no more, best believe
Yeah, that shit is banging, Bobby killed it with no time to grieve
I'm the one, bitch, I am the one, like Keanu Reeves
Get it done, yeah, I get it done, no blood on the leaves
They can't leave us hangin', no, no, not no more, best believe
Yeah, that shit is banging, Bobby killed it with no time to grieve, ayy

[Intro: Maluma & Karol G ]
Yay, ya-ah (Jajaja), dice
¿Cómo explicarle a la conciencia que esto fue mi culpa?
¿Cómo decirle al corazón que tú no volverás?
Hacer saber a mis ojos que no te verán nunca (Yeh, eh-eh)
¿Cómo explicarle a mi boca que no la besarás?

[Pre-Coro: Maluma & Karol G]
Y no es que muera porque no tenga tus besos
Pero es que vivir sin eso es como vivir sin razón
Y si tú supieras cómo me duele el proceso
De olvidarme de tu cuerpo, me destroza el corazón

[Coro: Karol G]
Créeme un poco más, te lo suplico
Que te me fuiste y no merezco este castigo
Soy un loco más que no ha entendido
Si yo sólo te daba amor, ¿por qué te has ido?
(¿Por qué te has ido?)

[Verso 1: Maluma, Karol G]
Es que se sentía un frío terrible (Frío terrible)
Ya no sé ni cómo decirte (Cómo decirte)
Contigo me sentía invencible (Ya lo sabe')
Me amas pero, ¿de qué me sirve?

[Pre-Coro: Maluma & Karol G]
Si aquí no estás
En el mejor momento te vas
Solo pido una oportunidad pa' demostrarte
(Dame una oportunidad, mamacita)
Que lo nuestro es amor de verdad
Pero ya tú no estás, en el mejor momento te vas
(En el mejor momento te vas)
Solo pido una oportunidad pa' demostrarte
Que lo nuestro es amor de verdad

Hmm
Yo-yo-yo no puedo olvidarte y no lo niego (¡Rrra!)
A pesar del tiempo que pasó sin entendernos
Yo sí sabía que por la monotonía
De mi te irías, y qué ironía

Hide you in my coat pocket, where I kept my rebel red
I felt I was invincible, you wrapped around my head
Now different lives I lead, my body lives on lead

The lead is terrible in flavor
But now you double as a paper maker
I despise you sometimes, I love to hate the fight
And you in my life is like

And I know where I been 'cause I bled before, yeah
How do I know if I let you stay?
How do I know if we did it your way?
You wouldn't take my place
Put me away, I'd die lookin' up at your face
How do I ever know? Who can I trust?
Feelings of emptiness
Only love could kill me, God bless

So swamped by high water, keep your head up, you might drown
In this world, it's way colder, by the day, we count it down
Been around, just been waitin' up, she gon' come around
I took a drag, bust it out the gate, my lil baby, slay
I wore a flag, put that on my face, ain't nobody safe
Lift the mask, they gon' have to see what they can't erase
I took a lot, so I took it back (Do-do-do-do-do, yeah)
Danger's on my mind
Ain't no knife, dagger, bullet that can do it

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I was born of the ice and snow
With the winter wolves, in the dark, alone
The wildest night, I became the one
And you'll know you're mine when the silence comes

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
Heavy is the crown only for the weak

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
A knife in my heart couldn't slow me down
'Cause power is power, my fire never goes out
I rise from my scars, nothing hurts me now
'Cause power is power
Now watch me burn it down

[Verse 2: SZA]
I been down with the coldest war
And I know where I been 'cause I bled before, yeah
How do I know if I let you stay?
How do I know if we did it your way?
You wouldn't take my place
Put me away, I'd die lookin' up at your face
How do I ever know? Who can I trust?
Feelings of emptiness
Only love could kill me, God bless

[Chorus: The Weeknd, The Weeknd & SZA]
A knife in my heart
Couldn't slow me down (Couldn't slow me down)
'Cause power is power ('Cause power is power)
My fire never goes out
I rise from my scars
Nothing hurts me now (Nothing hurts me now)
'Cause power is power ('Cause power is power)
Now watch me burn it down

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
Breathe, feel the air that I breathe (Yeah)
Air that I, air that I breathe
Who's hotter? Been a monster with a crown
So swamped by high water, keep your head up, you might drown
In this world, it's way colder, by the day, we count it down
Been around, just been waitin' up, she gon' come around
I took a drag, bust it out the gate, my lil baby, slay
I wore a flag, put that on my face, ain't nobody safe
Lift the mask, they gon' have to see what they can't erase
I took a lot, so I took it back (Do-do-do-do-do, yeah)
Danger's on my mind
Ain't no knife, dagger, bullet that can do it
'Fore you, yeah, you know, I go right straight through it, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: SZA]
Heavy is the crown, but never for a queen (Oh yeah)

[Intro]
Why're men great 'til they gotta be great?
Woo!

[Verse 1]
I just took a DNA test, turns out I'm 100% that bitch
Even when I'm crying crazy
Yeah, I got boy problems, that's the human in me
Bling bling, then I solve 'em, that's the goddess in me
You coulda had a bad bitch, non-committal
Help you with your career just a little
You're 'posed to hold me down, but you're holding me back
And that's the sound of me not calling you back

[Chorus]
Why're men great 'til they gotta be great? ('Til they gotta be great)
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face (Tell it straight to my face)
Best friend sat me down in the salon chair (Down in the salon chair)
Shampoo press, get you out of my hair
Fresh photos with the bomb lighting (Bomb lighting)
New man on the Minnesota Vikings (Minnesota Vikings)
Truth hurts, needed something more exciting (Yee)
Bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay (Eh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
You tried to break my heart?
Oh, that breaks my heart
That you thought you ever had it
No, you ain't from the start
Hey, I'm glad you're back with your bitch
I mean, who would wanna hide this?
I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever be your side chick
I put the sing in single
Ain't worried 'bout a ring on my finger
So you can tell your friend, ""Shoot your shot"" when you see 'em
It's okay, he already in my DMs

Getting freaky in the sheets, we're takin' body shots

[Verse 1]
You ain't got a clue, let's be honest
I had a couple seeds and made a forest
I put in the work and take the profit
Lookin' at my girl like, ""What a goddess"" (Thank God)
Rule number two, don't make the promise
If you can't keep the deal then just be honest (Just be honest)
I could never die, I'm Chuck Norris (Chuck Norris)
Fuck the government and fuck Boris (Yeah)
I'm a villain, killin' when I'm barrin'
Brothers in the hood just like the movie that I star in
Servicin' my whip, I phoned the boss to bring my car in
I could probably take your chick, but I just wouldn't 'cause she's jarrin', oh
I got the sauce (Sauce), don't know what you thought (Thoughts)
Catch me up in snowin' in my sliders and my shorts (Shorts)
Chicks tryna get my brother Flipz to share his thoughts
I think he's tryna tell me I should tell her he don't talk
I don't fuck with her
Yeah, I used to hit it but you're stuck with her
Man, I wouldn't even try my luck with her
Gyal say I'm bougie (Word), way too exclusive (Word)
Chillin' in Dubai, know I get it all inclusive (Word)
Now may I ask if you can find it in your spirit (Yeah)
To leave us all alone and go and mind your fuckin' business
Lookin' in the mirror sayin', ""Mikey, you're the illest"" (Yeah)

All this flyin' overseas is always fuckin' up my body clock
And all this stress has got me wreckin' up my brain (Ayy, ayy)
So tell these likkle fishes back up off my name (Ayy, ayy)
I ain't gotta be a rapper with a chain
Cah the rules are kinda different when you're baddin' up the game (Straight)

[Intro: ScHoolboy Q]
Fall in this bitch, transfusion with the drip drop
Sauce everywhere and got broccoli in my Ziploc
Tatted on my face, no role model, that's for Kid Bops
Got it on my waist, let that shit rock, I’m floating

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Floating, I'm floating, floating, floating, floating, floating
Floating, I'm floating, floating, floating, floating, floating
Swag on max, got no legs, bitch, I’m floating
Might turn into a ghost, punk bitch, yes, I'm floating
Floating, I'm floating, floating, floating, floating, floating, floating
Floating, I'm floating, floating, floating, floating, floating, floating
Swag on max, got no legs, bitch, I'm floating
Might turn into a ghost, punk bitch, yes, I'm floating (Woo)

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Take it off, yeah, going off, yeah
Money been here, the body's in here
I'm bringing up hell, the chopper don’t fail
The product get late, the pussy gon’ wait
The money I chase, the 'Rari don’t break
You killing my pace, the Carti' my face
A mil' in my safe, now hand me that tape
Ten toes in the mud, who the plug getting wrapped?
Ten-tone yellow pill, selling seals and it's facts, ayy
I ain’t trying to wife you, too emotional ('Motional)
Now take this in and out like it's supposed to go
Made it out the hood, had to bounce right quick (Bounce right quick)
Wonder how I drop out, learn to count like this (Learn to count like this)
Got a new house and a condo where I keep my shit (Where I keep my shit)
Got a shoestring 'round the thing thing, they don't build like this
Okay, I'm floating, ayy

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Floating, I'm floating, floating, floating, floating, floating

Pay me for a show, I got a chopper (21)
All this metal, they gon' call the coppers (21)
Can't run the game 'round rappers (Straight up)
'Cause I hang around all robbers (On God)
Little nigga, do you got a problem? (What?)
Little nigga, we'll come and solve it (Straight up)
Cash coming in, can't stop it (21)
I'm running to the money, y'all jogging (Yeah)
Richard Milles represent victory (21)
Still the same, I'm just a richer me (On God)
A washed-up bitch don't mean shit to me (Nothing)
I'ma let your best friend nibble me (Yeah)
You can't do nothing for me

[Letra de ""Baila Baila Baila (Remix)"" ft. Daddy Yankee, J Balvin, Farruko & Anuel AA]

[Intro:  Ozuna, Farruko, Ozuna & Anuel AA]
Ella casi ni sale, la traicionó el amor
Tiene pa'l de amistade’, pero no quiere relación
Donde va sobresale, en sus ojos se ve la ilusión (Se ve la ilusión)
Pero llamó a su amiga, que se olvide, que esta es su canción (Woh, oh, oh)
¡Remix!

[Coro: Ozuna, Daddy Yankee & Anuel AA]
Y baila, baila, baila (Baila, baila)
Ponle música pa' que esto no pare
Baila, baila, baila (Woh, oh, oh; oh-oh, oh)
Tengo que besarte ante' que se acabe
Baila, baila, baila (Baila, baila)
Ponle música pa’ que esto no pare (You ready?)
Baila, baila, baila (Oh; baila, baila)
Tengo que besarte ante' que se acabe (What?)

[Verso 1: Daddy Yankee]
Mami, llégale al código con el perreo sólido
Esta te la dedico pa' que suelte' el estré'
Acércate al perímetro y rompe lo' termómetro'
Si tú abre' la vía, te vo’a parquear el tren
Me gusta cómo lo hace’ cuando te atreve'
Tenía’ escondida esa actitu', ey

[Puente 1: Daddy Yankee]
Tu piquete me gusta, le da cómo e'
Con la' chispa’ al aire, botella 'e Moët
Grábate un video y que lo vea tu ex
¿Y qué fue? (¡Sube!), eh
Tu piquete me gusta, le da cómo e'
Con la' chispa' al aire, botella 'e Moët
Grábate un video y que lo vea tu ex
¿Y qué fue? Me gusta como—

[Verso 2: J Balvin & Ozuna]
Baila porque quiere olvidar
Ponle reggaetón pa' que la veas sudar
Sexy sube su videíto a IG
Entra al club, no le hace falta el ID
Ya no deja que la hieran
Se va en busca de sus amigas, que la noche es pasajera
Pa' bailar usa ropa ligera
La atención llama y eso que ni se esmera (Woh-oh, oh-oh)

[Puente 2: J Balvin & Ozuna]
Su flow es natural, le gusta inventar
Más conmigo, que soy su preferido
Y ella e' la mía, no la voy a cambiar (Jaja)
Su flow es natural, le gusta inventar
Más conmigo, que soy su preferido
Y ella e' la mía, no la voy a cambiar

[Coro: Ozuna, Daddy Yankee & J Balvin]

Baila, baila, baila (Baila, baila, baila)

Baila, baila, baila (Baila, baila, baila)
Tengo que besarte ante' que se acabe

[Verso 3: Farruko]
(Pri-yah, yah, ¡Farru'!)
Cuando pusieron su canción, se grabó pa' Insta' (¡Blep!)
Bailando y cantando sola en la pista
Ella anda sola, suelta y soltera
Y taguea a su' amiga' pa' romper la carretera
Y está mordí'a y bien despechá' (Eh, eh)
Y dice que hoy se va a emborrachá'
Y desde que se dejó, la tipa no para 'e janguear
Ya no quiere nada serio, lo que quiere e' vacilar (¡Farru'!)

[Verso 4: Anuel AA]
(Oh-oh, oh; Anuel)
DJ, pon reggaetón o bachata
Como sea, bebé, tú me mata'
Sin censura, tu cuerpo a oscura'
Perreando e' una locura

[Puente 3: Anuel AA]
Uah (Uah), tu figura (Tu figura), uah (Uah), tú desnuda (Desnuda)
Soy adicto a tu calentura, tú ere' una tortura
Uah, tu figura (Figura), uah, tú desnuda
Solo por un beso como Aventura, mami, hazlo por la cultura

Pooh, you a fool for this one
Ha
Oh Lord, Jetson made another one

[Chorus]
Hah
Pack in the mail, it's gone (Uh)
She like how I smell, cologne (Yeah)

Yeah, yeah

Play if you want, let's do it (Ha)
I'm a young CEO, Suge (Yeah)
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
The first nigga play, I'ma body a nigga (Ha)
I just checked my balance
I'll probably pull up to your hood
And come buy me a nigga (No cap)
You know that your ho told you that nigga crazy
Don't think that she lied to you, nigga (Bitch)
Get caught with your ho when I'm poppin' 'em both
Now they high just like Bobby and Whitney (Haa)
Say I'm the goat, act like I don't know
But fuck it, I'm obviously winnin'
Don't make me go hit the bank and take out a hundred
To show you our pockets are different (Ha)
I'm out with your bitch and I only want knowledge
She got a lil' mileage, I'm chillin' (Uh)
You disrespect me and I'll beat your ass up
All in front of your partners and children (Ahh, ahh)
I'm the type to let a nigga think that I'm broke
Until I pop out with a million (I pop)
Take 20K and put that on your head
And make one of your partners come kill you (Yeah)
Say he fuckin' with me then he gotta grow up
'Cause this nigga gotta be kiddin' (Kiddin')
This shit, it can't fit in my pocket
I got it, like I hit the lottery, nigga (Hot, hot, hot)
Opp, I'll slap the shit out a nigga
No talkin', I don't like to argue with niggas (I don't)
Ain't gon' be no more laughin'
You see me whip out guns, I'm gon' be done shot me a nigga (No cap)
I don't follow no bitches on IG
But all of your bitches, they follow a nigga (Ha)
And that lil' nigga ain't gon' shoot shit with that gun

You little niggas wanna be internet gangster
Man, tell all these little niggas stop that (Ha)
Been done burnt me a nigga in front of the store
Where your mammy and grandmama shop at (Bitch)
Hopped out on a whole other wave from these niggas
Let's see one of you little niggas top that
I will turn a nigga into a convertible
Push me a lil' nigga top back (Vroom)
Her boyfriend be hatin' and callin' her groupie
Just 'cause she like all my music (Ha)
She'll send me a text and then delete the message
He tryna find out, it's confusin'
I don't know what these niggas is thinkin' about
Use the brain in your head 'fore you lose it (Bitch)
I'll pull up after school and I'll teach her some shit
Tell your bro I'm a motherfuckin' tutor
'Member I used to cheat off a pretty bitch test
All the teachers, they thought I was stupid (Uh huh)
Was expectin' the box to pull up on a truck

I won't ask you to hold me
'Cause that won't mend what's helpless

Not a song I could sing for your mind to change

Oh, when did you fall out of love with me?

Like we're walking down a road of broken glass

[Verse 1: P!nk]
Boy, you make it sound so pretty even when it's not
Didn't choose, but it's the only one we've got
And sometimes, I get so tired of getting tied up in my thoughts
You're the only one that ever makes it stop

[Chorus: P!nk]
God, it hurts to be human
Without you, I'd be losing
And someday, we'll face the music
God, it hurts to be human

[Post-Chorus: P!nk]
But I've got you, you, you, you, you, hey
And you've got me, me, me, me, too

[Verse 2: Khalid]
Like we're buckled and preparing for the crash
Like we're walking down a road of broken glass
Now if we defeat all odds and it was us against the world
You can count on me, you know I'd have your back

[Chorus: P!nk & Khalid]
God, it hurts to be human
Without you, I'd be losing
And someday, we'll face the music
God, it hurts to be human

[Post-Chorus: P!nk & Khalid]
But I've got you, you, you, you, you, hey
And you've got me, me, me, me, too
But I've got you, you, you, you, you, hey
And you've got me, me, me, me, too

[Bridge: P!nk, Khalid & Both]
Hope floats away
If you could spend a day in my shoes
Your mind would change
If you knew what I've gone through
We want the same (Yeah, we do)
Maybe then you'd understand
How it hurts to be human, oh

[Chorus: P!nk & Khalid, Khalid]
God, it hurts to be human
Without you (Without you)
I'd be losing (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And someday, we'll face the music (Yeah)
God, it hurts (Yeah) to be human

[Post-Chorus: P!nk & Khalid]
But I've got you, you, you, you, you, hey
And you've got me, me, me, me, too
But I've got you, you, you, you, you, hey
And you've got me, me, me, me, too

Everybody wanna be lit, everybody wanna be rich
Everybody wanna be this, if I was you, I'd hate me bitch

Iceberg want a bag, bitch

[Chorus: Polo G]
We pop out at your party, I'm with the gang
And it’s gon' be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
I'm a killer, girl, I’m sorry, but I can't change
We ain't aimin' for your body, shots hit your brain
We come from poverty, man, we ain't have a thing
It's a lot of animosity, but they won't say my name
Them killers rock with me, lil' nigga, don’t get banged
’Cause they'll do that job for me while I hop on a plane

[Verse 1: Polo G]
She don’t like her body, left the doctor with a new shape
Blowing up my phone 'cause she just see me with my new bae
Heartbreaker, ladies love me like I'm Cool J
She was tryna cling onto a nigga, but it's too late
Booked a flight to Cali, racks and condoms in my suitcase
And every single dollar in these bands got a blue face
Diamonds in the Rollie, they in HD like it’s Blu-Ray
The way that I been ballin' should make the cover of 2K
Show out for the summer I might pull up in a new Wraith
Dissin' on the gang that's gon' only get your crew chased
And we hawk shit down, better tighten' up yo' shoe lace
Lil bro get up close let the Glock 22 spray

[Chorus: Polo G]
We pop out at your party, I'm with the gang
And it's gon' be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
I'm a killer, girl, I'm sorry, but I can't change
We ain't aimin' for your body, shots hit your brain
We come from poverty, man, we ain't have a thing
It's a lot of animosity, but they won't say my name
Them killers rock with me, lil' nigga, don't get banged
'Cause they'll do that job for me while I hop on a plane

[Verse 2: Lil TJay]
I call lil' bro, he said he ready for the stain (Said he ready for the stain)
What you claim? You a lame, you ain't never put in pain (Put in pain)
Swear I be around some killers that go crazy for the gang (They go crazy for the game)
If I showed you all my charges, you won't look at me the same (You won't look at me the same)
Made some choices in my life I wish I never had to make (Wish I never had to make)
Lost my brother, seen him die and I just seen him graduate (I just seen him graduate)
Got that .40 on my side and I'm just rollin' patty cakes (I'm just rollin' past jakes)
Both my hands can do the job and I ain't talkin' masturbate
I was in and outta state (State) 'cause I had a bag to make (Bag to make)
I risked my life but it's aight 'cause God ain't let me pass away (Pass away)
Fuck tomorrow, spin the block, just know we comin' back today (Back today)
I call Polo, he come dolo, we get 'em the fast way

[Chorus: Polo G]
We pop out at your party, I'm with the gang
And it's gon' be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
I'm a killer, girl, I'm sorry, but I can't change

The way that I been ballin' should make the cover of 2K
Show out for the summer I might pull up in a new Wraith
Dissin' on the gang that's gon' only get your crew chased
And we hawk shit down, better tighten' up yo' shoe lace
Lil bro get up close let the Glock 22 spray

[Chorus: Polo G]
We pop out at your party, I'm with the gang
And it's gon' be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
I'm a killer, girl, I'm sorry, but I can't change
We ain't aimin' for your body, shots hit your brain
We come from poverty, man, we ain't have a thing
It's a lot of animosity, but they won't say my name
Them killers rock with me, lil' nigga, don't get banged
'Cause they'll do that job for me while I hop on a plane

[Verse 2: Lil TJay]
I call lil' bro, he said he ready for the stain (Said he ready for the stain)
What you claim? You a lame, you ain't never put in pain (Put in pain)
Swear I be around some killers that go crazy for the gang (They go crazy for the game)
If I showed you all my charges, you won't look at me the same (You won't look at me the same)
Made some choices in my life I wish I never had to make (Wish I never had to make)
Lost my brother, seen him die and I just seen him graduate (I just seen him graduate)
Got that .40 on my side and I'm just rollin' patty cakes (I'm just rollin' past jakes)
Both my hands can do the job and I ain't talkin' masturbate
I was in and outta state (State) 'cause I had a bag to make (Bag to make)
I risked my life but it's aight 'cause God ain't let me pass away (Pass away)
Fuck tomorrow, spin the block, just know we comin' back today (Back today)
I call Polo, he come dolo, we get 'em the fast way

[Chorus: Polo G]
We pop out at your party, I'm with the gang
And it's gon' be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
I'm a killer, girl, I'm sorry, but I can't change
We ain't aimin' for your body, shots hit your brain
We come from poverty, man, we ain't have a thing
It's a lot of animosity, but they won't say my name
Them killers rock with me, lil' nigga, don't get banged
'Cause they'll do that job for me while I hop on a plane

[Verse 1: Jungkook, V]
반짝이는 별빛들
깜빡이는 불 켜진 건물
우린 빛나고 있네
각자의 방 각자의 별에서

[Verse 2: J-Hope, RM, Suga]
어떤 빛은 야망
어떤 빛은 방황
사람들의 불빛들
모두 소중한 하나

어두운 밤 (외로워 마)
별처럼 다 (우린 빛나)
사라지지 마
큰 존재니까
Let us shine

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin, Jin]
어쩜 이 밤의 표정이 이토록 또 아름다운 건
저 별들도 불빛도 아닌 우리 때문일 거야

[Chorus: Jimin, Jungkook]
You got me
난 너를 보며 꿈을 꿔
I got you
칠흑 같던 밤들 속
서로가 본 서로의 빛
같은 말을 하고 있었던 거야 우린

[Hook: Jungkook]
가장 깊은 밤에 더 빛나는 별빛
가장 깊은 밤에 더 빛나는 별빛
밤이 깊을수록 더 빛나는 별빛

[Verse 3: RM]
한 사람에 하나의 역사
한 사람에 하나의 별
70억 개의 빛으로 빛나는
70억 가지의 world

[Verse 4: Suga]
70억 가지의 삶 도시의 야경은
어쩌면 또 다른 도시의 밤
각자만의 꿈 Let us shine
넌 누구보다 밝게 빛나
One

[Pre-Chorus: V, Jungkook, Jimin]
어쩜 이 밤의 표정이 이토록 또 아름다운 건
저 어둠도 달빛도 아닌 우리 때문일 거야

[Chorus: Jin, V]
You got me
난 너를 보며 꿈을 꿔

밤이 깊을수록 더 빛나는 별빛

[Bridge: V, Jin, Jungkook]
도시의 불, 이 도시의 별
어릴 적 올려본 밤하늘을 난 떠올려
사람이란 불, 사람이란 별로
가득한 바로 이 곳에서
We shinin’

You got me
난 너를 보며 숨을 쉬어
I got you

Oh let us light up the night
우린 우리대로 빛나

[Intro]
We be throwin' money in a spiral
Every time your girl hear my song, yeah, turn her right into my ho
She shake her ass (I'm working on dying), do the eye roll
Got a skinny thong like a tightrope
I be blowin' up like some pyro
Coupe 150, call it Kyro

[Verse 1]
If she left with me, she the right ho
Man, she ridin' me like a BMX
Man, she said the D is for Dyno
I got two horns like a rhino
It's no way you could buy ho
But I bought a mansion with a slide door
Yes, I opened up the slide door
So you can hear her hit the high note

[Bridge]
I like the way you (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
Money keep comin' in, I can't lose
Money keep comin' in, I can't lose
Foreign girls and they 10s, I can't choose
Foreign car got V10, I can't cruise

[Chorus]
I got different color on my diamonds, I can't even see the time
I don't wanna see her face, I'ma go and get behind
Drop the top on the Wraith, I'ma make it lose its mind
I just made 100K, it was quicker than a Vine
I was swingin' from a vine, tryna pull me down but I climb
I'ma get it, keep tryin', there's no reason for the cryin'
We the ones that be slidin', they the ones that be dyin'
Know my boys, they be ridin' and my doors suicide

[Verse 2]
Side note, you will never reach my goals (At all)
I be walkin' with a slime nose
And I'm also walkin' with my side ho
Only time I be walkin' when I'm on the moon, so I feel like Michael
I was talkin' to my little slime, that's a lil' lizard, call her Geico
In reality, I'm 5'4""
Stand on my money, now I'm 6'6""
Hit her once, now she dismissed
Can't fuck her sister, make her lick dick
Forty-orty make my hip thick
When I see an opp, make the clip hit
Aimin' at his top, boy you need a mop
Man, I'm goin' out with a vengeance
My pants, Raf Simons
My shoes, Rick-Rick
Your girl dipped my tartar sauce so she ate my dick like a fish stick
Hit it raw, yes, I am a dog, I don't do this shit for no image
All my diamonds, they be hittin' hard
Try to play me boy, that's a scrimmage

[Chorus]
I got different color on my diamonds, I can't even see the time
I don't wanna see her face, I'ma go and get behind
Drop the top on the Wraith, I'ma make it lose its mind
I just made 100K, it was quicker than a Vine
I was swingin' from a vine, tryna pull me down but I climb
I'ma get it, keep tryin', there's no reason for the cryin'
We the ones that be slidin', they the ones that be dyin'
Know my boys, they be riding and my doors suicide

[Verse 3]
Live it up, you can just go any day now
Mykko Montana, this beat is from K Camp
Got frost on my diamonds, I'm gettin' the cake now
Now stay on your stomach, lil' bitch, when you lay down
Live it up, 'cause you can go any day now
Mykko Montana, this beat is from K Camp
Frost on my diamonds 'cause I got the cake now
When you on your stomach, lil' bitch, better lay down
I'm so up and I can't turn it down
They counted me out, my whole life turned around
Clean up my diamonds, you know I got rinse it
Know my boys comin', you know they mean business
That advance that you waitin' for, already spent it
When I’m on the beat man, you know I'm gon' kill it

[Verse 1: Jin]
또 져버린 것 같아
넌 화가 나 보여
아른대는 Game over over over

[Verse 2: Jungkook]
만약 게임이라면
또 load하면 되겠지만
I guess I gotta deal with this, deal with this
Real world

[Verse 3: J-Hope]
Ay, uh
차라리 게임이면 좋겠지
너무 아프니까
I need to heal my medic
But I’m another star
완벽하지 못했던 나를 탓해
Brake in my head, brake in my step, always
그저 잘하고 싶었고
웃게 해주고 싶었는데.. damn

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin]
Please give me a remedy
멈춰버린 심장을 뛰게 할 remedy
이제 어떻게 해야 해
날 살려줘 다시 기회를 줘
Please give me

[Post-Chorus: Jungkook]
A remedy, a melody
오직 내게만 남겨질 그 memory
이쯤에서 그만하면
꺼버리면 모든 게 다 편해질까

[Verse 4: Jin]
괜찮지만 괜찮지 않아
익숙하다고 혼잣말했지만
늘 처음인 것처럼 아파

[Verse 5: J-Hope]
부족한 gamer, 맞아 날 control 못하지
계속 아파 ‘Cause 시행착오와 오만 가지
내 노래 가사, 몸짓 하나
말 한마디 다 내 미시감에 무서워지고
또 늘 도망가려 해
But 잡네, 그래도 네가
내 그림자는 커져가도 내 삶과 넌 equal sign
So 내 remedy는 your remedy

[Chorus: Jin, Jungkook]
Please give me a remedy
멈춰버린 심장을 뛰게 할 remedy
이제 어떻게 해야 해
날 살려줘 다시 기회를 줘
Please give me a

(Remedy)
또 다시 뛰고, 또 넘어지고
(Honestly)
수없이 반복된대도
난 또 뛸 거라고

So give me a remedy
멈춰버린 심장을 뛰게 할 remedy

[Intro: Persona - RM 가사]

나는 누구인가 평생 물어온 질문
아마 평생 정답은 찾지 못할 그 질문
나란 놈을 고작 말 몇 개로
답할 수 있었다면
신께서 그 수많은 아름다움을
다 만드시진 않았겠지
How you feel 지금 기분이 어때
사실 난 너무 좋아 근데 조금 불편해
나는 내가 개인지 돼진지
뭔지도 아직 잘 모르겠는데
남들이 와서 진주목걸일 거네
칵 퉤

예전보단 자주 웃어
소원했던 Superhero
이젠 진짜 된 것 같어
근데 갈수록 뭔 말들이 많어
누군 달리라고 누군 멈춰서라 해
얘는 숲을 보라고
걔는 들꽃을 보라 해
내 그림자
나는 망설임이라 쓰고 불렀네
걘 그게 되고 나서
망설인 적이 없었네
무대 아래든 아님 조명 아래든
자꾸 나타나
아지랑이처럼 뜨겁게
자꾸 날 노려보네 Oh shit
야 이 짓을 왜 시작한 건지
벌써 잊었냐
넌 그냥 들어주는 누가 있단 게
막 좋았던 거야
가끔은 그냥 싹 다 헛소리 같아
취하면 나오는 거 알지 치기 같아
나 따위가 무슨 music
나 따위가 무슨 truth
나 따위가 무슨 소명
나 따위가 무슨 muse
내가 아는 나의 흠
어쩜 그게 사실 내 전부
세상은 사실 아무 관심 없어
나의 서툼
이제 질리지도 않는 후회들과
매일 밤 징그럽게 뒹굴고
돌릴 길 없는 시간들을
습관처럼 비틀어도
그때마다 날 또 일으켜 세운 것
최초의 질문
내 이름 석 자
그 가장 앞에 와야 할 But

So I'm askin' once again yeah
Who the hell am I
Tell me all your names baby
Do you wanna die
Oh do you wanna go
Do you wanna fly
Where's your soul
Where's your dream
Do you think you're alive

Ah, shit
I don't know me
But I know the way there

My name is R
내가 기억하고 사람들이 아는 나
날 토로하기 위해
내가 스스로 만들어낸 나
Yeah 난 날 속여왔을지도
뻥쳐왔을지도
But 부끄럽지 않아
이게 내 영혼의 지도
Dear myself
넌 절대로 너의 온도를 잃지 마
따뜻히도 차갑게도 될 필요 없으니까
가끔은 위선적이어도 위악적이어도
이게 내가 걸어두고 싶은
내 방향의 척도

니가 사랑하는 나 또 내가 빚어내는 나

I just want a Rollie, Rollie, Rollie with a dab of ranch

[Verse 1]
Do you remember when we moved out?
My mum said, ""I love you, but it's a small house""
So we changed up and saved up
Gave up our town
We were dangerous, couldn't tame us
What's missing now?

[Pre-Chorus]
Time
Suddenly, we got no time
We're so busy doing life
That I miss your eyes on mine, mine

[Chorus]
If you just focus on me
Like we were sixteen
And plotting our lives
Can I wear your t-shirt
And sleep on you
While I dream of all the good times?
When we were sixteen

[Post-Chorus]
Like we were sixteen
Like we were sixteen

[Verse 2]
Do you remember the teacher said
""You're too young, too stupid, don't lose your head""
But years gone and we held on with the best intent
Just two kids who kicked it on MSN

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, time
Suddenly, we got no time
We're so busy doing life
That I miss your eyes on mine, mine

[Chorus]
Oh, if you just focus on me
Like we were sixteen
And plotting our lives (When we were plotting our lives)
Can I wear your t-shirt
And sleep on you
While I dream of all the good times?
When we were sixteen

[Post-Chorus]
Like we were sixteen
Like we were sixteen

[Bridge]
Let's take the love that we found
And give it back to ourselves
Sometimes these things don't work out
Sometimes there'll be no one else
They said we'd never even make it this far
But here we are
And we're still counting stars
Like we were sixteen

[Outro]
Oh, when we were sixteen

[Verse 1]
Do you remember when we moved out?
My mum said, ""I love you, but it's a small house""
So we changed up and saved up
Gave up our town
We were dangerous, couldn't tame us
What's missing now?

[Pre-Chorus]
Time
Suddenly, we got no time
We're so busy doing life
That I miss your eyes on mine, mine

[Chorus]
If you just focus on me
Like we were sixteen
And plotting our lives
Can I wear your t-shirt
And sleep on you
While I dream of all the good times?
When we were sixteen

[Post-Chorus]
Like we were sixteen
Like we were sixteen

[Verse 2]
Do you remember the teacher said
""You're too young, too stupid, don't lose your head""
But years gone and we held on with the best intent
Just two kids who kicked it on MSN

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, time
Suddenly, we got no time
We're so busy doing life
That I miss your eyes on mine, mine

[Chorus]
Oh, if you just focus on me
Like we were sixteen
And plotting our lives (When we were plotting our lives)
Can I wear your t-shirt
And sleep on you
While I dream of all the good times?
When we were sixteen

[Post-Chorus]
Like we were sixteen
Like we were sixteen

[Bridge]
Let's take the love that we found
And give it back to ourselves
Sometimes these things don't work out
Sometimes there'll be no one else
They said we'd never even make it this far
But here we are
And we're still counting stars
Like we were sixteen

[Outro]
Oh, when we were sixteen
We're still counting stars like we were sixteen
We're still counting stars like we were sixteen

[Chorus]
Three nights at the motel under streetlights in the City of Palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want
And you can call me names if you call me up
Three nights at the motel under streetlights in the City of Palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want
And you can call me names if you call me up

[Verse 1]
Feel like the least of all your problems
You can reach me if you wanna, stay up tonight, stay up at night
Green lights in your body language
Seems like you could use a little company from me
But if you got everything figured out like you say
Don't waste a minute, don't wait a minute
It's only a matter of time for you-ooh-ooh-ooh to-ooh-ooh-ooh
Tell me now, 'cause I've been up for, I've been up for

Call me what you want, when you want, if you want
And you can call me names if you call me up (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
I can't fix each and all your problems
I'm no good with names and faces
She sent me naked pictures from her neck down to the waist
I get my feelings involved, she stopped returnin' my calls
Her flaws turned into walls and barricades
And I'm too far gone in all the wrong ways
And now every long day is a bad one
I can't make you call or make you stay or take you off the pedestal
So I get lost in modern music, watchin' movies
Talkin' to the walls in my room
Walkin' through the halls in my head
Just tryna make sure it all makes sense, I ain't made of money
Maybe some day, you can take it from me?
I'm up too late, thinkin' 'bout you in M.I.A. for

We tear it up, tear it up, tear it up
(I'm workin' on dying)
Yeah

Fuck from the back, hit her once, that's a wrap (Let's go)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Rack, rack)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Rack)
Water on my neck, swim through that, that's a lap (Water)
Fuck from the back, hit her once, that's a wrap (Woah)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Fact, fact)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (A fact)
Water on my neck, swim through that, that's a lap (A fuckin' fact)

Fendi knapsack, while I'm spittin' Fendi facts (Facts)
I don't want you back, you a thot, you a nat (A fuckin' nat)
Just like his bitch ass, that fuck nigga will get clapped (Will get clapped)
Put a pause on that, you still broke, you ain't back (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I could never change, gotta stick to my routine
I'ma hit it once, then you know I gotta leave
Got addictive personality, I turned into a fiend
Okay, my money sky blue, but my new coupe is slime green
My boys whip work 'til the white turn all tan (Tan)
Saw a minivan followin' my brand new Lamb' (Lamb')
I had a F and an N in my hand (And an N)
All my bitches tens, no, I do not fuck no fans
I was checkin' my DMs, found out she was a man (No, no, no)
I can't DM, never, ever again (No)
Lucien on my vision, that's the only thing that's tran (Yeah)
Okay, okay, nigga, let's get it
Got your bitch on my top just like a fitted (Let's get it)
I don't want it no more, then I gotta clip it
Balmain jeans, on the front got the zipper
My ice game got cold, got sicker
I'm a Leo like lion, I'm Simba
Stand on my money, I'm tall like a center
June and July cold just like December
It's too low, then the car, I lift it
I know baby girl miss my drip, yeah
Girl, your breath stink, need a spearmint, many (Yeah)
You need to go and take a minute
But your ass fat, lemme go for the finish
Overseas, I'm eatin' croissants
Told a fuck nigga, ""Don't touch my crumpet"" (No)
She a lil' thot, can't wife no bird
Four years, I ain't touch no chick

[Chorus]
Whip back-to-back, back-to-back, back-to-back (Yeah)
Bentley, Hellcat, new Lambo and Maybach (Yeah)
I can't talk on the phone, think my shit is tapped (Hello?)

I don't want you back, you a thot, you a nat (Nat, nat)
Yes, that's them racks, that's them racks, that's them racks (Racks, racks)
Your jeans, they too fat, man, them shits, they relaxed
I got on Dior, and my skinnies, they all black
If we serve the sack, then we take that shit right back (Back, back)
650 for a hat, 6666 hundred for a jacket
Tried to hold me tight, but I didn't hug her back (No way)
'Cause she tried to snatch out my pocket with the racks (These racks)

No cree en amor a primera cita, pero conmigo si que se excita (Jajaja)

Ya me fui de Medellín, pero sé (Pero sé)
Que prontito estoy de vuelta otra vez (Otra vez)

[Verse 1]
Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

[Chorus]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know ﻿I was lost

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
I hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
I wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game﻿ made for everyone
And love is the prize

[Chorus]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost

I didn't know I was lost

Everybody got the same swag now
Watch the way that I tear it down
Stackin' my bands all the way to the top
All the way 'til my bands fallin' over
Every time that you leave your spot
Your girlfriend call me like, ""Come on over!""
I like the way that she treat me
Gon' leave you, won't leave me, I call it that Casanova
She say I'm insane, yeah
I might blow my brain out (Hey)

[Verse 1: Kehlani]
You act like you need remindin'
Tryna do it over, bring it back and rewind it
But all that glitters isn't gold, I was blinded
Should have never gave you my heart on consignment

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
And I can't believe the lies that I went for
Thought you was mine, but you decided to be with him though
You took my feelings and just threw 'em out the window
Feel like it's too hard to fall in love again, no

[Chorus: Kehlani]
On some nights like this, shawty, I can't help but think of us
I've been reminiscin', sippin', missin' ya
Can you tell me what's with all this distant love?
If I called, would you pick it up?
On some nights like this, I just wanna text you, but for what?
You gon' say you want me, then go switch it up
Just gon' play with my emotions just because, no (Oh)

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
All them times I played the fool for you
Thinkin' we could put it back together, thought we had forever
You never see my point of view
Our connection is so severed, you don't show no effort

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
And I can't believe the lies that I went for
Thought you was mine, but you decided to be with him though
Took my feelings and just threw 'em out the window
Feel like it's too hard to fall in love again, no

You gon' get my hopes high, girl
You gon' get my hopes high, girl
Just gon' tell me more lies, girl
Just gon' get my hopes high, girl

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
I've been way too good to you, you take me for granted
You was my day one since back at Big B's house on Adams
First day that we met, I flagged you down, I told you, ""Hit my line""
Used to promise me you'd never switch on me like Gemini
You think I'm a fool, ain't nobody stupid
I see all the signs, I see all the clues
Yeah, sometimes I reminisce 'bout that shit when I'm bingin'
Can't believe it's been a whole year, yeah, but...

[Verse 1]
Yeah, started off right
I can see it in your eyes
I can tell that you're wantin' more
What's been on your mind?
There's no reason we should hide
Tell me somethin' I ain't heard before

[Refrain]
Oh, I've been dreamin' 'bout it
And it's you I'm on
So stop thinkin' 'bout it

[Chorus]
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts (Yeah)
Can't get what we want without knowin' (No)
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

[Verse 2]
Oh, nah
Penthouse view, left some flowers in the room
I'll make sure I leave the door unlocked
Now I'm on the way, swear I won't be late
I'll be there by five o'clock

Oh, you've been dreamin' 'bout it
And I'm what you want
So stop thinkin' 'bout it

You used to hold me down

Love stays still and I'm frozen

Qué será eso que huele tan bien (Tan bien)
Pero en realidad sabe mal, ey
Y que me tiene desvelándome
Y tal vez tú me tendría' que avisar
Cuando ya no me quiere' ver, ah (No me quiere' ver)
Porque yo acá sigo esperándote
Qué mal por mí (Ah, ah)
Que haga frío acá afuera y tú hoy no quiera' salir (Quiera' salir)
Eh, ah; ey
Pero tranqui (Tranqui, tranqui)
Que el frío y la espera siempre fue costumbre pa' mí
Qué mal por mí, -í

[Estribillo: Paulo Londra]
Porque tal vez lo nuestro era sólo para divertirse (¡Wuh!)
Pero este tonto suele confundirse (Eh)
Y e' triste (Qué)
Que del finde ya no he vuelto a sonreír (Ay)

No tiene paciencia (-cia; yeh)
Le sobra experiencia
Al frente de la audiencia (¡Wuh!)
Normal que deleite (Ey)
Cuando pueda verle (Ay)
Demasiado inteligente como Einstein (Shh)
Hace lo que sea, no piensa en la gente (No)
Una chica que la admiro desde siempre
No la contratan pa' bailar porque se roba el show (¡Ay!)
No quiere ser modelo porque eso le aburrió (Nah)
No puede ser locutora porque con su voz enamoró
Tendría que ser ladrona porque te roba hasta el corazón (¡Wuh!)

Y si me mira, ¿qué hago? (Emm)
Seguro me quedo pensando en lo lindo que sería tenerte un ratito a mi lao'
Sólo mira; demasiado flow en esa piba (¿Qué?)
No anda con un combo porque opaca a las amigas (Woh)
Asesina; me hace mal, mal (Qué; bue)
Si la veo, llamo al 911 (Qué)
Porque sí sé que verla me duele y no me hace bien
Y si me habla (Y si me habla)

On my own, but still so crowded
Walls come down and the guards come up
But there's nowhere to run, I feel surrounded
Hurt feels better when I'm by myself
No one really means it when they're wishing you well
I got no one to call, no one
And people only love you when they're needing your wealth
Damn, laying down, staring at my ceiling fan
Everybody acting like they give a damn
Where is everybody when you need a hand?
I've been burning rubber on the Michelin
Flying in the rain like I'm Superman
I could say I love it, but that just depends

I’m in love with bad luck

괜한 기댈 하는 내가 미워
자꾸 똑딱 거리는 시계 소리가
유난히 거슬려

Don’t know what to do without you

[Songtext zu „Harami“]

[Pre-Hook]
Immer wenn der Gin in mein Glas fließt
Sitz' ich im Ferrari und bretter' Richtung Paris
Ja, wir tragen Giorgio Armani
Ich bin ein Harami, liebe nur Massari

[Hook]
Und immer, wenn der Gin in mein Glas fließt
Sitz' ich im Ferrari und bretter' Richtung Paris
Ja, wir tragen Giorgio Armani
Ich bin ein Harami, liebe nur Massari, rrah, rrah, rrah

[Part 1]
Sie gönn'n mir den Erfolg nicht, sie glauben nicht an Karma
Im Holzfällerhemd werd' ich Deutschrap sein Vater
Ich habe euch geschwor'n: Egal, wie oft ich fall', ich bleib' nicht liegen
Ein Gig, dreißig Riesen, für mich seid ihr Eintagsfliegen
Wir komm'n vorbei im C63 S Carbon
Sechs Patron'n, Samra, Al Capone
Wir sind Ghetto, sind Berlin
Sneaker, weiße Presto auf die Jeans und ich bretter' mit dem Jeep
Ja, ich steh' zu mein'n Entscheidungen, die letzte war kein Fehler
Geh' auf Eins und rappe 61 „Cataleya“
Sie will Goldschmuck, Aramäer, Neukölln, Porsche 911
Bretter' im Carrera und leb' meine Träume
Auf Schule war geschissen, lieber kummern in mein Kissen
Paar Jahre später, der Junge hat's gerissen
Ich bin Tony Soprano, Farbe Marokkano
Rolle in 'nem Lambo Gallardo

[Pre-Hook]
Und immer wenn der Gin in mein Glas fließt

[Part 2]
Sie gönn'n mir den Erfolg nicht, keiner, der es anerkennt
Kopfkrise, weil mich keine Frau so gut wie Mama kennt
Komme im Gabbana-Hemd, kippe Wodka Parliament
Mashkal-Araber-Gang, bada-bada-bang
Vielleicht geh' ich morgen drauf, dafür nehm' ich es in Kauf
All die Wege, die ich lauf', fall' und steh' wieder auf
Ich hab' viel zu schnell vertraut, aber leider Gottes, mon ami
Schmeckt das echte Leben bitter, so wie Kokain
Woah, in dir wächst nur der Mut
Wegen Testo im Blut willst du Stress, gibst Besuch
Anthrazit, böser Blick, Angel Eyes, BMW
Aggressiv und ich tick', Leitung heiß wegen Schnee
Ihr habt mich ausgelacht, denn vor Kurzem fuhr ich mit der U-Bahn
Bald siehst du meine Fresse riesengroß am Ku'damm
Keiner wird von Reste satt, rrah
Ich will beweisen, dass der Himmel keine Grenzen hat

[Verse 1]
Life is never easy when you need it to be
Try to knock me down, but I get back on my feet
Everybody's angry and they're coming for me (Coming for me)
But I can't give them energy that I won't receive (I won't receive)
So I brush 'em off, I got a lot on my sleeve
Like I'm moving backwards, but it's all on repeat
This place is getting crowded, I got no room to breathe
I hope the only thing I'm losing isn't my memory

[Chorus]
'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face
I'ma keep it moving, got a hundred things I gotta do today
'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face
I'ma keep it moving, got a hundred things I gotta do today

[Verse 2]
Now it's real, take your time, you're almost there
Wherever we’re going, gotta be prepared
We’ll be fine, are you scared? Are you scared?
People keep on talking 'bout what they wanna be
Walking down the line, but they don’t live what they preach (Live what they preach)
Sharing attributes with all our own enemies
You gotta pay to live and even dying ain't free

[Chorus]
'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face
(No, I won't give up, no, I won't give up)
I'ma keep it moving, got a hundred things I gotta do today
(Yeah, and I won't be waiting on you)
'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face
(No, I won't give up, no, I won't give up, no no)
I'ma keep it moving, got a hundred things I gotta do today, yeah

[Bridge]
You gotta take it slow (Alright)
Dust yourself off, don’t you lose control (Yeah, mmm)
Gotta take it slow
Dust yourself off, don’t you lose control
(Dust yourself off, don’t you lose control)
You gotta take it slow (Oh)
Dust yourself off, don’t you lose control
(Dust yourself off, don’t you lose control)
Gotta take it slow
Dust yourself off, don’t you lose control

Had a hundred friends, but I cut em off, I don’t need em
Not like any of them gave a fuck if I was breathing

Everybody wants a favor, everybody needs me
But I'm too busy trying to fight away all of my demons

On a grandi comme les princes de la ville, fous comme Prince de Bel-Air
Flow Corvette, Ford Mustang, dans la légende
La police d'une à six étoiles, à toujours se dire belek
Trop gentil comme Cody, sentiments dans la salle du temps
Il était une fois deux frères
Deux fauves, deux trous dans l'cerveau, poto, deux paires
Conditionnés au fond d'un hall sur une chaise
Emprisonnés, des rêves qui brisent plus d'une chaîne
Esprit de gosse caché derrière le V
Pris d'ambition en stagnant d'vant L.V
Salaire de bacqueux chaque soir dans les Nike
Bénéf' de la beuh qui part dans le mic'
On a grandi comme les princes de la ville, les rois du hall
Dans l'ciel, pas plus d'une étoile, en face du trône
Des grammes, des kill's de peine, même dans le bend'

D'la force au calme, au Kaïô-Ken, allez, c'est l'heure (allez, c'est l'heure)

J'ai grandi dans le zoo, j'suivais les cris dans la jungle, les pas de grand frère
Papa nous a cogné tête contre tête, nous a dit  : ""J'veux un amour en fer
J'veux personne entre vous, même pas moi, même pas les anges de l'Enfer"" (les anges de l'Enfer)
Donc j'ai aimé mon frère plus que ma vie, comme me l'a appris mon père
Chaque rêve, chaque cauchemar, chaque ennemi, chaque euro : partagés
Et à part le nombre de cicatrices, rien ne va changer
Dans le même, dans le même miroir, on s'est regardés
Dans les mêmes, dans les mêmes trous noirs, on s'est égarés
Quand on était petits, on avait les mêmes sapes, plus grands, les mêmes armes
Même niaks, même terrain, igo, les mêmes schlags
Jamais les mêmes femmes : moi, c'était les belles blondes
Lui, les Vénézuéliennes, moi dehors, lui qui tombe
Rien ne nous sépar'ra, même pas nos bitchs
Tout c'que j'prends, j'te l'donne, un peu comme ma vie
Y'a qu'toi qui sais c'que j'vis, que moi qui sais c'que tu vis

J'veux personne entre vous, même pas moi, même pas les anges de l'Enfer"" (les anges de l'Enfer)
Donc j'ai aimé mon frère plus que ma vie, comme me l'a appris mon père
Chaque rêve, chaque cauchemar, chaque ennemi, chaque euro : partagés
Et à part le nombre de cicatrices, rien ne va changer
Dans le même, dans le même miroir, on s'est regardés
Dans les mêmes, dans les mêmes trous noirs, on s'est égarés
Quand on était petits, on avait les mêmes sapes, plus grands, les mêmes armes
Même niaks, même terrain, igo, les mêmes schlags
Jamais les mêmes femmes : moi, c'était les belles blondes
Lui, les Vénézuéliennes, moi dehors, lui qui tombe
Rien ne nous sépar'ra, même pas nos bitchs
Tout c'que j'prends, j'te l'donne, un peu comme ma vie
Y'a qu'toi qui sais c'que j'vis, que moi qui sais c'que tu vis
On s'est dit, c'est l'heure d'les baiser, si on fusionnait, chi

[Refrain : Ademo]
Deux frères, deux frères
Deux frères, deux frères
Deux frères (M, M, M), deux frères
Deux frères (M, M, M), deux frères
Bats les couilles d'ces fils de pute, j'suis pas là pour être aimé, faudra t'y faire à l'idée
Rien à foutre d'ces catins des bois, d'ce rap de merde ou d'qui t'aura validé
Même plus besoin d'visser d'la qualité d'après vé-Her
D'la force au calme, au Kaïô-Ken, allez, c'est l'heure (allez, c'est l'heure)

Ah, ah, 'cause I can't sleep without you
No, I don't want to dream about you
Wish I had my arms wrapped around you (Insomnia)

Losing track of time, babe (Insomnia)
My mind is running too fast
Shadows on the wall keep lurking
I wish that you would come back (Insomnia)

[Pre-Chorus]
I keep on hoping to find you
Reaching in between the sheets
Baby, it's only been one night
Feel like it's been like a week

I got, I got, I got

Dass ich immer cool bleib', du bist wie die Glut heiß
Zu zweit, Baby, du hast Klasse wie Lehrer

Ich steh’ auf der Bühne, Baby, komm vor
Manchmal bin ich aber kalt, doch das kommt vor
Doch danach kleide ich dich ein wie ein Sponsor

Sie trägt Coco Chanel und kein Moncler

Vie

[Couplet 1 : N.O.S]
J'ai envie d’rentrer à la maison
Le chemin n'est plus le même maintenant qu'on a l’monde
Sur mon dernier flow dans mon bat' k'-skun
Y'a qu'les cafards et mes rêves qui rest'ront
Je fais une photo de ma vie, un peu plus qu'avant
Les doutes se confirment, un peu moins qu'avant
Les anges se confient
Et toi tu sauras jamais qui j’suis
Moi-même j’aurais du mal toute ma vie donc j'aurai besoin de revenir ici
J’te laisserai l'temps d'me décevoir mais le temps me laissera voir
Vais-je te plaire dans le noir ?
Dernier dans l'four à la recherche de lueurs
Quelques roses, beaucoup d’épines dans l'cœur
Même enfant sans les rêves, sans les pleurs
Et j'ai plein d'questions pour mon Créateur
En attendant j'traîne, j'fais plein d'erreurs
Et le passé fait vibrer mon cœur
J'veux plus qu'on survive, j'veux une vie meilleure, j'veux plus qu'ils se privent, vis tes rêves et meurs

[Refrain : Ademo & N.O.S]
Que la mif, que la mif, que la mif, que la mif
Rien n'a changé dans ma putain d'tête
J'suis hors des codes, j'te fais pas de bouquet
J'ai la rose mais t'es conne, j'joue pas au Saint-Valentin
Que du biff, que du biff, que du biff, que du biff
Rien n'a changé dans ma putain d'tête
T'sais la rue m'a piqué, m'a dit ""le litre c'est tant"", j'voudrais bien t'expliquer mais je té-comp, j'ai pas l'temps
Que la mif, que la mif, que la mif, que la mif
Rien n'a changé dans ma putain d'tête
Y'a d'la richesse dans nos âmes, y'a d'la misère dans nos yeux
Que du biff, que du biff, que du biff, que du biff

[Couplet 2 : Ademo]
J'ai envie d'être gang, j'ai pas envie d'rigoler
Pourtant j'ai l'sourire jusqu'aux pecs, sur la Mecque, mec (mec, mec)
La vie nous fait pleurer, j'ai envie d'être bête
Ne plus réfléchir, ne plus les pardonner, plus rien dans la tête
Et j'garde toutes mes larmes, des fois, mes yeux brillent
J'ai envie d'être vide, ne plus avoir d'âme, redevenir la bête
J'ai envie d'amour mais ça s'achète pas
Quand j'en donne, c'est gratuit, ces bâtards m'le rendent pas, drôle de concept
Et j'peux dire qu'j'ai le cœur gainé, le regard un peu du-per man
Et j'peux te dire qu'on a peur d'aimer, Tarik Clark, AD Superman
J'ai envie d'arrêter tout mais la hess m'a traumatisé, les gens qui m'ont suivi, j'peux pas les abandonner

Igo m'demandent tous de l’aide
Mais moi, j'suis rien sans cet oseille
Je roule que la peuf me balaie
Tordu, tordu par Corbeil
J'ai peur un peu pour moi, beaucoup pour toi
J’essaie de m'adoucir mais l'humain m'rend noir
Il reste quelques gens biens, je garde espoir
J'serais pas l'même sans les miens ou sans le noir
J'fais l'tour d’la pièce, la nuit, j’fais le tour d'la ville
Une gourde, j’fais l'shlag quand cette putain d'vie m'ennuie
Et si cette vie n’est pas bonne, j'la baiserais pas
J'veux pas être comme le roi, j'vaux mieux que ça
Nerveux comme équipe sans liquide
Recherche du bonheur, j'm'enfonce dans le vide
Le temps passe sur ton visage, le chrono' m'fait mal au bide
J'vois l'monde un peu à l'envers
J'attire les putes blanches aux sentiments noirs

Bats les couilles si tu parles trop hmm, c'est la rue qui t'abîme

J'mets ma casquette, elle m'rappellera toujours c'temps où j'tenais les murs

J'me suis détruit, en construisant l'avenir des miens
J'me remets en question avec des larmes dans mon vin

À croire qu'elle savait c'que j'deviendrai à l'av'nir
J'ai que des tics (sniff), à l'odeur d'l'argent (j'comptais)
J'me cache, compte, cache, le cash dans la chambre
Comme avant, comme demain ou comme avant-hier
Rien ne change à part que j'suis encore plus vieux (putain d'sa mère)
J'suis toujours gang, à la trentaine, j'dis toujours bang
Elle s'rappelle de mon coup d'rein sur du triple chain gang (gang, gang, gang, gang)
J'fume et puis j'tractionne en pronation (en pronation), j'sors ma bite dans les prolongations (prolongations)
J'suis serein dans ce corps en location
J'suis à cent pour cent d'mes dix pour cent, Epoque œil pour œil et bouche sur gland
Et j'passe au vert en billets d'cent, l'cœur pas si blanc et j'prie pourtant
J'souris, j'ai l'parfum du doré
Y'a très peu d'anges pour m'épauler

[Refrain : Ademo]
J'ai les douilles, j'fais pas la catine (lé-lé-lé)
Bats les couilles si tu parles trop hmm, c'est la rue qui t'abîme
Tu connais, faudra pas déconner, c'est AD qui taquine
Coco joue pas l'kéké, humble comme Kaká
Un peu survolté, un dos louche comme Blanka
Sous jamaïca, sors un flow comme Sanka

[Couplet 1 : N.O.S]
Igo m'demandent tous de l’aide
Mais moi, j'suis rien sans cet oseille
Je roule que la peuf me balaie
Tordu, tordu par Corbeil
J'ai peur un peu pour moi, beaucoup pour toi
J’essaie de m'adoucir mais l'humain m'rend noir
Il reste quelques gens biens, je garde espoir
J'serais pas l'même sans les miens ou sans le noir
J'fais l'tour d’la pièce, la nuit, j’fais le tour d'la ville
Une gourde, j’fais l'shlag quand cette putain d'vie m'ennuie
Et si cette vie n’est pas bonne, j'la baiserais pas
J'veux pas être comme le roi, j'vaux mieux que ça
Nerveux comme équipe sans liquide
Recherche du bonheur, j'm'enfonce dans le vide
Le temps passe sur ton visage, le chrono' m'fait mal au bide
J'vois l'monde un peu à l'envers
J'attire les putes blanches aux sentiments noirs

[Refrain : Ademo]
J'ai les douilles, j'fais pas la catine (lé-lé-lé)
Bats les couilles si tu parles trop hmm, c'est la rue qui t'abîme
Tu connais, faudra pas déconner, c'est AD qui taquine
Coco joue pas l'kéké, humble comme Kaká
Un peu survolté, un dos louche comme Blanka
Sous jamaïca, sors un flow comme Sanka

[Couplet 2 : Ademo]
J'mets ma casquette, elle m'rappellera toujours c'temps où j'tenais les murs
J'adoucis l'flow, l'regard si dur
J'me suis détruit, en construisant l'avenir des miens
J'me remets en question avec des larmes dans mon vin
J'disais : ""Mon ombre, tu sais, tu devrais fuir""
À croire qu'elle savait c'que j'deviendrai à l'av'nir
J'ai que des tics (sniff), à l'odeur d'l'argent (j'comptais)

[Verse 1]
So you're still thinking of me
Just like I know you should
I can not give you everything, you know I wish I could
I'm so high at the moment
I'm so caught up in this
Yeah, we're just young, dumb and broke
But we still got love to give

[Chorus]
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young dumb broke high school kids

[Verse 2]
We have so much in common
We argue all the time
You always say I'm wrong
I'm pretty sure I'm right
What's fun about commitment?
When we have our life to live
Yeah, we're just young dumb and broke
But we still got love to give

[Chorus]
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young dumb broke high school kids

[Bridge]
Jump and we think - do it all in the name of love
Love
Run into sin, do it all in the name of fun
Fun
Whoa-oa-oa
I'm so high at the moment
I'm so caught up in this
Yeah, we're just young, dumb and broke
But we still got love to give

[Chorus]
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
