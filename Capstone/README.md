# Project 6 - Spotify Streams Predictor


## Executive Summary

Create a tool that allows anyone to predict the amount of streams a given song will receive during its first week listed with Spotify. We use a mix of techniques including:

 - API Connections
 - Web Scraping
 - Natural Language Processing
 - Logistic Regression
 - Model Evaluation

Success is to build an application that predicts stream count and provides impact weights for each feature.

For Each Song Gather:

Spotify Song Search API - Basic info: duration, title, artist...
Spotify Artist Search API - Artist followers, popularity, genres, albums...
Genius API - Song versions and lyrics
Twitter API - User's tweets about artist


## Jupyter Notebook Structure

Jupyter Notebook walks through our modeling process with additional information into each model including:

- Creation Techniques
- features included
- validation methods
- model score
- conclusion of model results

## Deliverables

The project file includes each work element or tool used during this initial evaluation including: -  
- Jupytern Code Notebook (Models)
- Readme file with executive summary
- Data Files for each list
- Combined data files
- Conclusions Reccomendations
